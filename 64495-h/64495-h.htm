v</span>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Writer of the following pages
has, from the first announcement of the project, taken a sunny
view of the nature and tendency of the Great Exhibition.&nbsp;
Originating in the disinterested suggestions of the Illustrious
Prince Consort&mdash;designed and adapted to promote the
interests of art and commerce, and the fellowship of
nations&mdash;supported by persons, who, in addition to the
distinctions of rank or wealth, are remarkable for knowledge,
benevolence, and piety&mdash;promoted generally from a desire to
advance the welfare of our country and mankind&mdash;responded to
very extensively abroad as well as at home with manifest
cordiality and good will&mdash;and calling forth and securing the
prayers of Christians in reference to the undertaking&mdash;it
appeared to the Author to warrant cheering and hopeful
anticipations.&nbsp; The wonderful scene on the day of
opening&mdash;as must have been felt by those who have read the
graphic descriptions of it in the public prints, and especially
by those who were privileged to behold that <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>unprecedented
spectacle&mdash;was of a character to strengthen favourable
expectations of the result of the enterprise.&nbsp; The order,
harmony, and mutual kindness manifested by the vast multitude on
that occasion&mdash;the moral impression which it certainly made
on many&mdash;and the religious element introduced into the
august ceremonial, evidently awakening sympathy in thousands of
hearts which then beat with strange emotion&mdash;surely may be
regarded as tokens for good!</p>
<p>The Author is far from intending to assume a tone of confident
prediction&mdash;remembering that only the Infinite and All-wise
One can embrace the entire bearings and tendencies of human
events&mdash;but he may be allowed to confess, that while he does
not overlook the incidental evils to which such a vast gathering
of the people may give rise, his hopes decidedly predominate over
his fears.&nbsp; The following pages, expressive of thoughts and
feelings which are pervaded by the spirit thus indicated, are now
commended to the candid attention of the reader, with an earnest
prayer for the Divine blessing on their perusal.</p>

THE POET&rsquo;S DREAM.</h2>
<blockquote><p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>&ldquo;The bard beholds the work achieved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as he sees the shadow rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sublime before his wondering eyes,<br />
Starts at the image his own mini conceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Kirke
White</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> centuries ago there might have
been seen in the streets of old London, one of those gifted
mortals who are now and then sent into the world by the Father of
spirits, to stamp their name upon the age in which they live, and
to enshrine its memory amidst the splendours of their own
genius.&nbsp; With a deep and luminous insight into the scenes of
nature, the works of art and the ways of men, did there look
forth from those large bright eyes of his a poetic soul of an
order high and rare.&nbsp; As he passed along the highways of his
native city, to which he <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>tells us he had &ldquo;more kindly
love, and fuller appetite than to any other place on
earth,&rdquo; he was gathering materials for a living picture of
his times; or rather forming a photograph representation of men
around, catching in the magic mirror of his verse the evanescent
forms and colours, lights and shades, of our Proteus-like
humanity, and there retaining them in stedfast imagery for
ever.</p>
<p>Chaucer, though unhappily as a writer not free from moral
blemishes, was, like Hogarth, the great historic painter of his
age, sketching not armies in battle, or parliaments in conclave,
but a people in their costume and intercourse, their business and
pastime, their private habits and daily life.&nbsp; In turning
over the black-letter volume of his works, we see and hear our
ancestors, and talk with them.&nbsp; It is as if the very glance
of the eye, the quivering of the lip, and the tones of the voice,
had by some strange process been preserved by this wonder-working
artist.</p>
<p>But Chaucer often passed beyond the sphere of contemporary
realities.&nbsp; The lore of chivalry he was accustomed to weave
into a rich tapestry <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>of verse; and ideal realms, and groups of visionary
beings, he was wont to sketch with the power and beauty of a
Fuseli.&nbsp; It was in one of the playful flights of his
untiring fancy, that he touched on scenes and objects strangely
associated with the occasion of this little book;&mdash;it occurs
in a poem, well known as &ldquo;Chaucer&rsquo;s
Dream.&rdquo;&nbsp; Throughout the wild revellings of his genius,
which he has recorded in that production, it would be beside our
present purpose to follow him.&nbsp; The general plot and
machinery of the tale are in the extravagantly symbolic spirit of
the age,&mdash;utterly unlike what could happen at any period,
and not at all entering within the range of our conceptions
now.&nbsp; In the nineteenth century a poet&rsquo;s strangest
vision would not be like his.&nbsp; But amidst associations out
of all congruity with modern times did the bard we have described
fashion out a picture, almost the counterpart of what we have
lived to witness embodied in the actual work of men.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;had a dream which was not all a dream.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
imagined, standing on an island, a structure, whose wall and gate
were &ldquo;all of glass:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;And so was closed round about,<br />
That leaveless none came in or out&mdash;<br />
And of a suit were all the towers,<br />
Subtilly carven, after flowers<br />
Of uncouth colours, during aye&mdash;<br />
That never been, or seen, in May.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This island of the Crystal Palace he represents under the
sovereignty of a beautiful lady, who becomes wedded to a royal
knight, and he describes a festival celebrated in tents on a
large plain, by</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Prince, the Queen, and all the
rest,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>amidst a wood between &ldquo;a river and a well,&rdquo;
continuing for three months,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From early rising of the sun<br />
Until the day was spent and done.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coincidence between these parts of the poet&rsquo;s dream
and the reality of 1851, with respect to the place, the Palace,
the regal personages, and the period of the year, is singular
enough: it is one of those remarkable exploits of thought, which
appear sometimes in the form of reproductions of the past, and
sometimes in the form of anticipations of the
future,&mdash;exhibiting the counterpart of far distant things,
now on the page of history, then in poetic <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>strains, and
again in the records of science&mdash;likenesses between what has
been and what is, apparently without any connexion whatever:
likenesses which baffle the effort to explain the law of their
occurrence, and which seem to indicate the existence of
unfathomable sympathies between minds in ages present and remote,
and suggest to us yet once more the oft-told truth that there are
more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our
philosophy.&nbsp; What was the precise form and fashion of the
structure Chaucer pictured in his charmed isle we cannot tell;
but we question whether, even in his boldest dreams, he ever saw
aught so marvellous as that which the people of all lands are
flocking, or will flock, to see in our Hyde Park the present
summer.&nbsp; Chaucer was not ignorant of the ways of building in
the age in which he lived, for he was appointed clerk of the
works at Windsor Castle, in the year 1390; but assuredly, among
all the plans which were ever suggested by his genius, or adopted
by his judgment, as capable of being reduced to realities, such a
thing as the grand transparent Hall of Industry never entered his
mind.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>It may
indeed be said, that every beautiful work of art was once a
dream,&mdash;it floated in the imagination before it was fixed
and made visible by the hand.&nbsp; A picture by Corregio or
Rubens is a painter&rsquo;s dream transferred to canvass.&nbsp;
The Apollo Belvidere is a sculptor&rsquo;s dream carved in
marble.&nbsp; Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; is a
poet&rsquo;s dream committed to paper.&nbsp; Strasburg Cathedral
is an architect&rsquo;s dream built up in stone.&nbsp; Thousands
of strange images arise in artistic minds which of necessity
never find expression in any actual work; some, also, worthy of
being set in ripe and lasting fruit, perish in the blossom: but
all the great productions of ancient and modern times assuredly
constitute a harvest, of which the seeds were only dreams.&nbsp;
To whatever order of genius the origin of the Crystal Palace
belongs, it certainly embodies a beautiful dream, which in a
happy hour lighted on the fancy of Mr. Paxton.&nbsp; It was
shaping itself into form during the few days he thus
describes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was not until one morning when I was
present with my friend Mr. Ellis, at an early sitting in the
House of Commons, that the idea of sending in a design occurred
to me.&nbsp; A <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>conversation took place between us, with reference to the
construction of the New House of Commons, in the course of which
I observed that I was afraid they would also commit a blunder in
the building for the Industrial Exhibition.&nbsp; I told him that
I had a notion in my head, and that if he would accompany me to
the Board of Trade, I would ascertain whether it was too late to
send in a design.&nbsp; Well, this was on Friday, the 11th of
June.&nbsp; From London I went to the Menai Straits, to see the
third tube of the Britannia Bridge placed, and on my return to
Derby, I had to attend some business at the Board-room, during
which time, however, my whole mind was devoted to this project;
and, whilst the business proceeded, I sketched the outline of my
design on a large sheet of blotting-paper.&nbsp; Having sketched
this design on blotting-paper, I sat up all night until I had
worked it out to my own satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus was created in the inventor&rsquo;s mind an image of his
work, with a rapidity precursive of the speed with which the work
itself has since been realized.&nbsp; The dream grew up and bore
its ripened fruits in a few hours: the Industrial <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Palace, in a
few months, has attained its full perfection; so that, as if by
miracle, it now looks like the old fig-tree,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such as at this day to Indians
known&mdash;<br />
In Malabar or Deccan, spreads her arms,<br />
Branching so broad and long, that on the ground<br />
The bending twigs take root, and daughters grow<br />
About the mother tree; a pillar&rsquo;d shade,<br />
High overarch&rsquo;d, and echoing walks between.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not know whether Mr. Paxton possesses what is generally
understood by a poetic mind; but, certainly, no one who has gazed
on the stupendous structure erected in Hyde Park, according to
his plan, but must feel that a poetical idea there stands
expressed.&nbsp; So gigantic in its dimensions, simple in its
form, and graceful in its details, it awakens a sense of vague
wonder, which, on a careful survey of the object exciting it,
subsides into calm, intelligent admiration.&nbsp; It inspires a
curiosity to examine into the parts and proportions of so strange
an edifice&mdash;into the minute and delicate filling up of so
bold an outline; and commends itself to the taste and judgment of
the spectator, as it spreads out before his eye, like the pages
of a volume, and reveals, on close inspection&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&mdash;&ldquo;The subtle shining secrecies<br />
Writ in the glassy margin of such books.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seen a little while ago, as the morning vapours rolled round
its base,&mdash;its far stretching roofs, rising one above
another, and its great transept, majestically arched, soaring out
of the envelope of clouds, its pillars, window-bars, and
pinnacles enamelled with rich hoar-frost, the trees around it all
sparkling with the same bright ornament,&mdash;the structure
looked literally a castle in the air, like some palace, such as
one reads of in idle tales of Arabian enchantment, having about
it all the ethereal softness of a dream,&mdash;being itself
&ldquo;the fabric of a vision,&rdquo; rather than a structure of
solid and enduring material.&nbsp; Looked at from a distance at
noon, when the sunbeams come pouring upon the terraced and
vaulted top, it resembles a regal palace of silver, built for
some eastern prince; when the sun at eventide sheds on its sides
his parting rays, the edifice is transformed into a temple of
gold and rubies; and in the calm hours of night, when &ldquo;the
moon walketh in her brightness,&rdquo; the immense surface of
glass which the building presents, looks like a sea or lake
throwing back in flickering smiles the radiant <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>glances of
the queen of heaven.&nbsp; Ever does it repose in its strong,
though not stone-built, foundations&mdash;the very image of
beauty and strength.</p>
<p>The antecedent of this great work&mdash;the parent
construction, of which it is the offspring, nobler than its
sire&mdash;had more than a dash of poetry about it.&nbsp; The
building we refer to is the glass conservatory at Chatsworth,
contrived for the preservation of the gigantic water-lily, found
on new-year&rsquo;s day, 1837, on the river Berbice, in Demerara,
and sent to England by sir Robert Schomburgh.&nbsp; The arrival
of the extraordinary plant, with its six-foot leaf, shaped like
an elegant salver, and adorned with broad rims of green and
crimson, was warmly welcomed by that patron of botanical science,
the duke of Devonshire, and forthwith committed to the charge of
Mr. Paxton, then and still the scientific and tasteful
horticulturist-in-chief at the far-famed paradise of the
Peak.&nbsp; Improving upon all his former improvements in the
arrangement of glass-houses, he contrived a fitting receptacle
for this new specimen of the western flora, surnamed the
&ldquo;<i>Victoria Regia</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;so well had
everything been prepared for <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>its reception, that it flourished as
vigorously as if it had been restored to its native soil and
climate.&nbsp; Its growth and development were astonishingly
rapid, for on the 9th of November a flower was produced a yard in
circumference.&nbsp; In little more than a month after the first
seeds ripened, some of them were tilled; and on the 16th of
February succeeding, young plants made their appearance.&nbsp;
The extraordinary lily obeyed nature&rsquo;s law of development
with such unexpected rapidity, that it outgrew the dimensions of
its home in little more than a month.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
circumstance gave rise to a new conservatory of much greater
extent, out of which has grown the idea of the present, and much
vaster one, for receiving the world&rsquo;s industry&mdash;one
which throws its predecessor into the shade, and which, in
addition to its other wonders, included within its vitreous walls
some fine old trees, above a hundred feet in height.</p>
<p>To return again to Chaucer; we cannot help thinking how much
there is in this glass palace, and in what is connected with it,
which would have seemed even to his credulous fancy, more strange
and startling than any dream.&nbsp; Whence <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>all the glass
could come, needful for a building composed chiefly of such
material, and of length more than quadruple that of St.
Peter&rsquo;s Abbey at Westminster, would have sorely puzzled our
architect and poet to divine, in days when glass windows were so
little used, that his great contemporary, William of Wykeham, who
built Windsor Castle, was hard put to it to find twelve glaziers
to do the work there, and actually had to <i>press</i> men into
the service from different counties!&nbsp; The unity of
principle, too, pervading the whole construction&mdash;everything
in the great building being a dividend or multiple of twenty-four
<a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a>&mdash;so different from the bold, yet
not inharmonious, irregularity of the cathedrals, churches, and
castles which Chaucer had seen; and the variety of uses
sub-served by one and the same member of the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>edifice;
columns serving the purpose of water-drains, and the floor being
at once a ventilator and a dust-trap, securing conveniences of
which he never thought, and strangely different from the cumbrous
contrivances employed for such simple and necessary ends as were
then contemplated,&mdash;would have startled and discomposed him
with a long-enduring surprise.&nbsp; And, then, the haste with
which the beautiful dream has been wrought out into
well-compacted wood and glass and iron, the few months taken for
its completion&mdash;rapid as the growth of the <i>Victoria
Regia</i>; and the thousands of men engaged in its
erection,&mdash;the preparation of the parts before they were
brought together,&mdash;the strange machinery employed in the
preparation,&mdash;the fact of the structure serving as a
scaffold for itself&mdash;and the small expense of the whole, not
amounting to more than one halfpenny per cubic foot,&mdash;these
items in the history of the building would surely have made him
open his eyes and lift up his hands in wild astonishment.</p>
<p>But the strangeness of the dream ends not here.&nbsp; We must
think of what is included within this vast area, what is
exhibited in its long aisles and galleries where are gathered <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and arranged
the productions of every art in every clime&mdash;arts which five
hundred years ago had no existence, and climes then
undiscovered.&nbsp; Articles, a list of which will fill a portly
volume; the handiwork of man and woman in every sort of usable
material.&nbsp; Works of strength and skill for necessity and
convenience&mdash;for comfort and luxury&mdash;for ornament and
display&mdash;things carved, and moulded, and woven&mdash;vast
and minute, bold and elegant, simple and elaborate, running
through all the conceivable departments and grades of inventive
industry!&nbsp; Groups, heaps, masses of all manner of cunning
work!</p>
<p>And the whole of the contents in this hive of the world
classified according to the clime from which they come!&nbsp; At
the extreme east of the edifice one sees the productions of
America, our young and ardent rival in ingenious toil.&nbsp; Next
are the fruits of rising art in Russia, with specimens of skilful
labour sent by Norwegians and Swedes.&nbsp; There are found rich
stores from the shops of German craftsmen.&nbsp; The Zollverein
exhibits its treasures in close vicinity to these; and beyond are
seen contributions from the provinces of Austria.&nbsp; <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>The Dutch,
the Belgic, and the French vie with each other further on; and
close to them, Portugal, Spain, and Italy also appear in friendly
contest for the palm of pre-eminence.&nbsp; Switzerland, in the
contiguous space, spreads out her various wares, beside which
Brazil and Mexico deposit their rich freights; and then Egypt,
Turkey, China, Greece, Persia, and Arabia, in close
neighbourhood, exhibit a harvest of oriental taste.&nbsp;
Crossing the transept, at once a garden and a
refectory&mdash;where, beneath over-arching trees, and beside
sparkling fountains, the spectator of this the world&rsquo;s
great horn of plenty may refresh himself with various
delicacies&mdash;he is forthwith introduced to the products of
the distant &ldquo;Ind,&rdquo; and the numerous ramifications of
our colonial dependencies, to terminate at length this tour
around the globe, performed under a case of glass, with a sight
of the immense assemblage of our home manufactures, gathered from
almost every town and village in the British Isles.&nbsp; Nine
miles of table-room are thus passed in review; and it would
require days and weeks to circumnavigate this epitome of the
manufacturing world, and only to glance with anything like
intelligence <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>at the various divisions of its affluent stores.&nbsp; A
traveller who has visited in detail the chief manufactories of
European countries must feel himself to be in a kind of dream,
when looking on these achievements of human industry brought
together, not merely from the English provinces, and the European
continent, but from the remotest regions of this and the other
hemisphere.&nbsp; A dream, then, indeed, would it have seemed to
the father of English poetry, with his limited knowledge of
geography and art, could he have paced along these spacious
alleys, lined with the peaceful spoils of all the earth.</p>
<p>The sight of these interesting objects is suggestive of
important reflections.&nbsp; Imagining oneself left alone in the
vast building&mdash;permitted to tread in silence the deserted
halls&mdash;what musings might arise relative to themes awfully
beautiful, which the giddy portion of the daily crowd within the
walls have never entertained!</p>
<p>This repository of art, with all its varied contents, is the
production of the human mind.&nbsp; Its constructive skill is
singularly exhibited in the edifice itself; not such constructive
skill as <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>can be confounded with the instinct of the bird or bee,
not a blind impulsive power; but a clear-eyed intelligence, which
can survey, and consider, and contrive, and adapt, and fashion,
according to the exigency of the case, in ways more various than
art can classify.&nbsp; Of the power of human discovery, the
detection of latent qualities in nature, a remarkable example is
afforded in the history of the material out of which the building
itself is chiefly wrought.&mdash;That the vitrification of sand
and nitrium, noticed accidentally by the Ph&oelig;nician
mariners, according to the once generally received account by
Pliny; or that some other occurrence at a much earlier period, as
is now commonly believed, should have led men to perceive, in
materials perfectly opaque, capabilities of transformation into a
substance perfectly transparent; that out of dingy masses of
mineral could be spread forth sheets of liquid diamonds, broad as
the awning over the Coliseum at Rome; that it was possible to
mould this brittle material, as if it were so much wax or clay;
that, hard as rock, it might be blown into a bubble soft and
light as a drop of water; that, white as the sunbeam, it could
receive <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>and retain all the dyes of the rainbow; constitute a
series of marvels, forming but one out of a thousand chapters
included in the annals of human discovery.&nbsp; The plastic
power of the human mind is also here displayed in the almost
infinitely diversified forms which, under its touch, the rude
materials of nature have received.&nbsp; Timber and stone, cut
into elegant shapes for useful purposes, or with astonishing
truthfulness made to resemble the most delicate expressions of
animated nature, even to the feather of a bird and the petal of a
flower!&nbsp; Earth moulded by hand or machinery, and metals
wrought or cast in a thousand mimic fashions!</p>
<p>Nor should we omit to notice, in these objects of art, a deep
desire to embody in material things the <i>beau id&eacute;al</i>,
to rise above the dull purpose of mere utility and convenience,
to give a touch of beauty to the commonest aids and implements of
life, to lift art to a lofty sphere, and to surround it with a
brilliant halo.&nbsp; Man is seen as the lover of artistic
perfection, tasking his powers to conceive and execute what shall
at least approach a standard too lofty for him yet to measure,
but of the existence of which <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>he has the consciousness, deep though
dim.&nbsp; He may be said to fight a battle with the obstinate
resistance of material nature, and though oft defeated, still
struggles for the victory!&nbsp; The spiritual takes possession
of the physical, as a foreign realm, which it seeks to subdue to
its own purposes.&nbsp; The <i>distinct essence</i> of the soul
is also asserted.&nbsp; Its attempt to rule over all around, and
to enrich itself with the spoils of the conquered region, is not
a contest with a co-ordinate and equal power, but it is the
effort of a kingly nature so formed by God, created in his image,
and inaugurated into regal office, at the beginning when the
charge was given, &ldquo;Replenish the earth and subdue
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The superiority of the mind over all material
nature is thus unequivocally proclaimed.</p>
<p>And amidst all this, does he not catch glimpses of things
purer, nobler, and more enduring than the things of earth?&nbsp;
Does he not feel at times that there are objects existing
somewhere, incomparably more beautiful than any work of
art?&nbsp; Has he not raised within him a conception of invisible
and spiritual realms more wonderful than the material?&nbsp; And
is there not also to be recognised, in the ambition of the artist
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>who
strives to produce a work which his admirers vainly call
immortal, a strong craving for some after-existence&mdash;a
flinching from the thought, that death is to put an end to
all&mdash;a wish, at least, to impress some characteristic idea
of his own on some portion or particle of the great whole of
things, so that he may live by representation if not in
consciousness.</p>
<p>Yet, while such musings on the works of men open up to us
deeps of power and beauty in the soul, they only reveal a small
division of the vast world of human nature.&nbsp; We visit but a
single province of the intellectual realm: we leave unexplored
the vast domains enriched by the growths of literature and
science; while the emotions, social affections, moral feelings,
and religious capacities of the soul remain untouched.&nbsp; No
account is here taken of conscience, and of the capability of
knowing, loving, and serving his Maker, which form the highest
distinction of man&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp; Yet even from our
partial and limited view of the subject, we derive no slight
conviction of the immortality of that nature to which such
attributes as we have described belong.&nbsp; Great as may be the
mystery of a future existence, most certainly the mysteries <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>connected
with the denial of this truth are greater still.&nbsp; It
involves the supposition that what in nature, power, and
capability is perfectly distinct from the material form in which
it dwells, and by which it works, is to perish with
it:&mdash;that the inmate is to die with the decay of his
dwelling, the artist expire with the breaking of his
implement;&mdash;that a being possessed of unbounded capacities
of improvement is destined to advance only a few steps in his
proper career, and then be arrested in his course for
ever;&mdash;that a life of thought and feeling, which contains
the germs of higher thoughts and feelings, awaiting, as essential
to their full development, other influences than those which are
shed on earth, is to be succeeded by eternal unconsciousness and
oblivion;&mdash;and that a soul which finds in the present life a
range too narrow for the full and vigorous scope of its nascent
powers and feelings, is to be disappointed in its earnest
longings and deep-seated hopes.&nbsp; It involves the supposition
of a Divine design intimated, and then thrown aside&mdash;a
Divine promise pledged and broken.&nbsp; The Great Architect
would appear constructing a portico as if introductory to a
magnificent temple, and <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>then, suddenly stopping short in the
work, breaking it down, and scattering its beauty in the
dust.</p>
<p>The construction of the Crystal Palace, with its contents, is
a monument to the superiority of mind over matter; and that
superiority indicates some great destiny hereafter.&nbsp;
Immortality rises upon the eye of reason in the hazy distance:
but confidence in relation to the future state must come from
another quarter, through the exercise of faith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Life
and immortality&rdquo; are brought &ldquo;to light through the
gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor can we properly terminate reflections of this order
without going back to the source and origin of mind.&nbsp; If the
material universe bears witness to the existence and character of
a Great First Cause; if &ldquo;the invisible things of him from
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by
the things that are made;&rdquo; if &ldquo;the heavens declare
the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork;&rdquo;
if the earth be full of his goodness; how much more does the soul
of man, with all its capacities and powers, its intellect and
genius, and, above all, its moral and religious susceptibilities,
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>bear
testimony to the being and attributes of the Creator.&nbsp; The
marks of design in the mind of man, himself a designer, are more
astonishing than those which we have in visible things.&nbsp; The
power and beneficence of God, in giving us faculties of thought
and susceptibilities of affection, appear with a plainness of
expression even beyond what we discover in any of the material
provisions for our comfort.&nbsp; While the whole universe is a
volume in which God has, as it were, written down his thoughts,
what page in it is so wonderful as the human mind?&nbsp; Whatever
is great or beautiful in the imagination of man&mdash;whatever
there is to admire in the works of his hands, fashioned according
to the intellectual type within, must be traced up to the
infinite source of intelligence, as its origin.&nbsp; Man has
nothing which he has not received.&nbsp; What then must that
unrevealed fount of beauty be, of which all the choice thoughts
and beautiful imaginings of men from the beginning, however they
have been expressed, are but as drops and spray!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> allusions we have made to
Chaucer and his dream, in connexion with the Crystal Palace,
suggest some very obvious but interesting reflections on the
difference between the order of civilization which existed in his
day, and that which obtains in our own.&nbsp; There are works of
art and facts of history associated with his times, and not
entirely unassociated with himself, which, by being brought under
our review and placed beside the Great Exhibition, with its
treasures and purposes, will <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>exhibit the difference between the
two epochs of our country&rsquo;s progress in a peculiarly
striking light.&nbsp; It should be observed however, in the first
place, that the fourteenth century, like the nineteenth, was an
era of progress.&nbsp; The blooming of poetic genius after the
long winter of the middle ages, was in itself an indication that
some new impulse had been given to the mind.&nbsp; The perfection
which Gothic architecture attained at the same period, in the
bold proportions, the noble forms, the chaste and elegant
adornments, and all the grand and beautiful effects of the
decorated style&mdash;the revival too of mercantile pursuits
which then took place, owing very much to the influence of our
third Edward, who to the title of Hero of Cressy appended the
better title of the Father of English Commerce&mdash;were also
signs and tokens of advancing civilization.&nbsp; To these we
should add the remembrance of the mental activity and dialectic
skill of the schoolmen then rife in our universities, fostering a
spirit of inquisitiveness, and promoting an independence of
thought and individuality of character, which could hardly fail
at length to break through the trammels in which for a long
period <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>they patiently toiled: nor should we forget the bearing
upon society and the spirit of the age, of the early efforts at
ecclesiastical and religious reformation commenced by Wickliff
and his compeers.</p>
<p>But between that past age of excitement and the present there
are contrasts bolder than any resemblance which can be
traced.</p>
<p>Windsor Castle may be said to have been built in the middle of
the fourteenth century, when Chaucer was a youth; and with the
completion of some parts of the palatial edifice and the
contiguous chapel he, as we have seen, was associated.&nbsp; That
building was a sign not only of the artistic, but of the social
state of civilization at that period.&nbsp; The stern-looking old
fortress of former times, the very symbol of feudalism, the type
of individual, firm, unconquerable resistance, was succeeded by
less forbidding piles of architecture; and&mdash;to adopt the
idea of a French writer at that period&mdash;the kingly and
baronial edifices of the fourteenth century relaxed somewhat
their rigid features, and seem to &ldquo;<i>laugh</i>&rdquo;
through their oriel windows, as they looked down on the gay
quadrangle glittering with the arms and banners of <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>chivalry.&nbsp; But the royal building at Windsor,
though it was of the new order of architecture, and showed that
taste was re-establishing her empire,&mdash;though it evinced
some advance upon a previous condition of social disorder, when
the rough net-work of feudal government kept things together in a
very loose and imperfect manner, it also betrayed in its broad
moats, machicolated towers, and other grim-looking
fortifications, that a period of social tranquillity and quietude
had not arrived.&nbsp; It was still needful to have the
drawbridge and the sally-port, the loophole in the wall and the
turreted walk on the top for the bow-man.&nbsp; The whole aspect
of the place, with its warden and garrison, indicated liability
to baronial attack, or popular outbreak.&nbsp; It was to be
inferred that peer, burgess, and peasant were held still in some
distrust, that law had not yet the strength of hand it needed to
check the pride of the rich and curb the passions of the
poor.&nbsp; We may look on Windsor Castle, as it stood in
Chaucer&rsquo;s time, as an exponent of an unsettled state of
society, when the great tumults and agitations which had swept,
wave after wave, over the European world had not spent their <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>force and
died away.&nbsp; The erection of a glass palace, strong indeed
and enduring, if untouched by violence, and preserved by care,
but, under opposite circumstances, frail and perishable in the
extreme; its open and unprotected situation on the skirts of the
great metropolis, and beside one of its chief and most frequented
highways; its full exposure to general observation, and its
openness to the approach of all, are facts which tell loudly in
testimony of the altered state of society in which our lot is
cast.&nbsp; Such a structure thus undefended is out of all
harmony with the bygone times to which we have just referred,
when tumults and deadly conflicts in the streets were of common
occurrence, when property was ever in danger of rapine and
plunder, and the approach to a city or town was left unlined by
hedges lest they should furnish convenience for ambush to the
thief or assassin.&nbsp; It proclaims the supremacy of law, the
exaltation of that invisible and hallowed guardian of our rights,
not only to a seat of physical power whence it can make its
mandates felt, but upon the throne of the public mind, which has
been taught reverently to bow before its majesty.&nbsp; It
indicates <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>the general education of the people&mdash;their improved
intelligence and taste&mdash;their better social
habits&mdash;their acknowledgment of the rights of
property&mdash;their regard for order, and their love of
peace.&nbsp; It shows that the last five hundred years have been
years of social improvement, and leads us to ponder the causes
which have wrought the change.&nbsp; Then there pass in review,
the decline of feudalism, the development of the free principles
of our constitution, the invention of printing, the reformation
of religion, the progress of arts and science, the improvement of
courts of justice, the institution of a well organized police;
but, above all, the efforts of the preacher and the schoolmaster,
those two most efficient labourers in the cause of moral
civilization.&nbsp; This large array of agencies, with many
others here overlooked, have been doing their silent work through
hundreds of past years.&nbsp; Here we have the tillers of the
soil, and the sowers of the seed, from which has sprung the
harvest of social order and security which crowns the middle of
the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Referring again to the regal edifice reared by Edward <span
class="GutSmall">III.</span> we are reminded of the method <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>by which
labourers were obtained for the execution of the works.&nbsp;
Ashmole tells us, that to the end they might be <i>honestly</i>
and duly performed the sovereign issued letters patent to press
hewers of stone, carpenters, and other artificers, also to
provide stone, timber, and other materials.&nbsp; They were
gathered in London, and out of divers counties in England, by
virtue of writs directed to the sheriffs, who were to take
security that the workmen should not depart without license,
under the penalty of &pound;100; and, because some left Windsor
clandestinely, proclamation was made to punish the fugitives with
imprisonment in Newgate, and any one who dared to employ them,
with a forfeiture of all his goods.&nbsp; This circumstance,
while it illustrates the small pecuniary resources of the
sovereign, throws a strong light on the condition of the
labouring classes.&nbsp; The personal liberty of the subject was
but half conceded by the unconstitutional assumptions of the
royal authority.&nbsp; The artisan was little better than a
villain or serf, in whose labour the monarch was supposed to have
a vested and indefeasible interest.&nbsp; The latter was still,
to a considerable degree, the great <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>feudal lord of the land, having a
supreme proprietorship in the persons and possessions of a
vassal-like people.&nbsp; Marvellous and happy is the change that
has come over England since then, as is shown by the history of
the building before us!&nbsp; Not the product of a monarch,
seeking to gratify his pride, and to surround himself with luxury
at the expense of his people; but the enterprise of the people
themselves by their own voluntary contributions, commenced,
indeed, and encouraged by the suggestion and patronage of a
prince illustrious and beloved&mdash;the erection of the
Industrial Palace is connected with no violation of the rights of
property or labour.&nbsp; If the English working man has still
some evils in his social condition of which to complain&mdash;if
his neck be still chafed by a yoke real or fancied&mdash;he
should remember that his condition is enviable compared with that
of his fathers.&nbsp; His strength and skill are his
estate.&nbsp; He has the liberty to sell them in what market he
may think the best.&nbsp; No regal mandate can interfere with the
perfect mastery which he claims over himself.&nbsp; Not an axe or
hammer has been used in the building but by the free <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>will of him
who wielded it.&nbsp; The edifice looks more majestic than ever
when contemplated as the work of a nation of freemen.&nbsp; The
money freely given&mdash;the labourers freely assembled&mdash;the
work freely done.&nbsp; The fact proclaims to the world the
wealth and liberty of England, the last the best preserver of the
first, and the sure pledge, we trust, under the blessing of the
Almighty, of her enduring power and growing prosperity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine
elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casting back once more a glance upon the fourteenth century,
another point of contrast presents itself between the past and
present significant of the condition of the arts, especially in
connexion with the religion of the times.&nbsp; Loud has been the
boast of the admirers of the medi&aelig;val system in relation to
its artistic aspects, with which, however, it must also be
remembered, that while a corrupt church cultivated the
imagination in subservience to its own superstitions, it blinded
the nobler faculty of reason.&nbsp; That age certainly could
boast of beautiful trophies.&nbsp; To say nothing of the
architect whose cathedrals and churches <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>awaken the
wonder of posterity, the sculptor chiselled his images for the
niche, the shrine, and the tomb;&mdash;the limner exercised his
infant skill upon the vellum pages of illuminated <span
class="GutSmall">MSS.</span>, or in bolder decorations for
altarage and stall;&mdash;the stainer of glass dyed the windows
of the chapel, the convent, and the castle, so as to present
pictures of saints and heroes, or &ldquo;a tissue of variegated
crystals, a transparent mosaic of gems, through which the light,
like flame, might pass through the varied pomp of earthly
hues;&rdquo;&mdash;the graver of brass preserved the images of
the dead in graceful outline, full of the expression of deathlike
repose, and therewith paved the choir and aisles trodden by the
feet of surviving worshippers;&mdash;the carpenter and the
cabinet-maker enriched their respective works with quaint but
oftentimes picturesque carvings;&mdash;the smith plied his art in
the manufacture of metals into various imitative forms, rearing
iron screens of mimic architecture, curiously adorning a lock, or
elaborating the hinges of a door;&mdash;and the goldsmith and
jeweller fashioned and chased and studded with gems the images
and utensils employed in popish worship, and the salt-cellars, <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>bowls,
chargers, and other pieces of plate, which sparkled on the
festive board of the prince and noble.&nbsp; Between these works
of art, <i>as such</i>, and the productions of our own day, it is
not our purpose here to institute any comparison; we notice them
now only <i>as signs of civilization</i>, and the fact which they
illustrate under this view is the limitation of the employment of
art at that time to a very few uses, deemed sacred or
noble.&nbsp; All above the lowest class of artificers were
employed exclusively in the service of the church, and the
highest classes of the state.&nbsp; They were dependent upon the
Abbey or Castle, or upon the rising wealth and budding taste of
some city merchant.&nbsp; The people, in general, had nothing to
do with works of art except to produce them, or to gaze on them
from afar in their religious worship, or when they were permitted
humbly to participate in the magnificent festivities of their
lordly superiors.&nbsp; The houses, furniture, and vessels of
all, except the highest class, were of the meanest and most
untasteful kind.&nbsp; Rough and rude were all the arrangements
of their dwellings, and all the appliances of their domestic
life; artistic beauty was absorbed <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>and concentrated elsewhere&mdash;no
traces of it were to be found in the peasant&rsquo;s cottage, or
even the tenement of the common burgess.&nbsp; This fact, as
indicative of the condition of the people in reference to their
domestic civilization, is what, in the language of lord Bacon,
may be styled &ldquo;a <i>glaring instance</i>&rdquo;&mdash;one
that stands naked and open,&mdash;and this in an eminent manner,
and in the highest degree of significance.</p>
<p>No one can survey the immense assemblage of articles in the
Great Exhibition without being struck with the signs they afford
of a state of civilization, the opposite of that just
noticed.&nbsp; Here Art is seen extending its territory over all
the regions of life.&nbsp; If in the service of religion among
Protestants, she is not tasked as was once the case, we do not
deplore the circumstance.&nbsp; Without a calm judgment and a
pure heart, she is apt to become in the so-called house of God,
the maid-servant of superstition.&nbsp; Only up to a certain
point was she allowed to go under the Old Testament dispensation,
when her services were largely in demand for constructing and
beautifying the tabernacle and temple.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt
not make unto thyself any graven image,&rdquo; was a check put
upon the ingenious <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>devices of a Bezaleel and an Aholiab, and upon all
&ldquo;who had wisdom to devise curious works, to work in gold,
and in silver, and in brass, and in the cutting of stones, to set
them; and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under the present dispensation, when the
worship of the Father is to be in spirit and in truth, in
<i>contrast</i> with the worship instituted by Moses, and
therefore not merely unformal and unhypocritical, (which pure
worship always was and must be,) but <i>un</i>symbolic, a still
stronger restraint must be put on the activity of artistic skill
within the houses of prayer called after the name of him who
talked with the woman of Samaria.&nbsp; The busiest and most
elaborate efforts of art are, therefore, as we conceive, properly
removed from the house of God, by his own solemn interdict upon
their employment there, lest man should make God&rsquo;s most
precious gift subject to vanity,&mdash;while the faculty of
ingenious invention seeks and finds full scope for its exercise
in increasing, multiplying, and adorning the conveniences and
comforts of life among all classes.&nbsp; Art is mainly intended
to refine and ennoble what specially <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>belongs to this mortal life.&nbsp; In
this respect she has the power of elevating man&rsquo;s social
condition by evoking and gratifying a taste for the beautiful;
art is seen thus fulfilling her mission in the
myriad-achievements of human skill which this Great Exhibition
spreads with such lavish wealth before spectators from all
climes.&nbsp; Passing beyond purposes of mere utility and
convenience, in the accomplishment of which, however, they
abound, the fabricators of all this various furniture for the
homes of men, have sought to breathe into it the spirit of the
beautiful.&nbsp; Not only does elegance of design, and accuracy
of execution, mark those costlier productions which are intended
for the drawing-rooms of the rich and great, but they appear in
the cheap and simple provisions for the parlours and kitchens of
the poor and humble.&nbsp; Modern European society is thus coming
back to that pitch of artistic civilization which distinguished
old Greece in her palmy days, when &ldquo;the plastic and
presiding spirit of symmetry shed its influence over the minutest
details of ordinary occupation, and the shapes of the commonest
utensils.&rdquo;&nbsp; The influence of fine art is thus rendered
universal.&nbsp; Civilization in that form is <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>seen
generally diffused.&nbsp; The sharp barriers of rank are broken
down, the grades of society under the touch of wide-spread taste
assimilate to each other; their boundary lines soften, become
more and more indistinct, and gradually melt away.</p>
<p>To return again to the age of Edward.&nbsp; In the beginning
of the year 1358, says old Knighton in his
&ldquo;Chronica,&rdquo; the king issued his royal proclamation
throughout all England, that all knights strangers from any part
of the world, who had a mind to come to the feast of St. Georges,
to be held on the 23rd of April, at Windsor, should have his
letters of safe conduct to pass and repass the realm at their
pleasure, for the space of three weeks without the least
impediment or danger, there to partake every one according to his
degree and merit of those honours and prizes which attended the
princely exercises of jousts and tournaments.&nbsp; And
accordingly this great feast was held, and thither went in their
suits of armour, and with devices emblazoned on their shields,
with all the pomp and circumstance of chivalry, John of France
and the duke of Brabant, and many noble lords and knights from
&ldquo;Almain, Gascogne, <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Scotland, and other
countries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Philippa, the heroic wife of Edward, and
the queen of the king of Scots, were present with a whole bevy of
high-born dames to gaze on the tilt and tournay.</p>
<p>Punctiliously, according to chivalrous custom, did the
gorgeously coated heralds and pursuivants proclaim and enforce
the laws of the encounter.&nbsp; Proudly did the combatants take
lance in hand and rush to the combat,&mdash;with eager eyes and
beating hearts did matron and maiden look on husband and
lover,&mdash;and with boisterous shouts of joy did the crowding
populace hail the prowess of the conqueror.&nbsp; The scene was
typical of the age.&nbsp; It was an exposition of the spirit
predominant in our own land, and throughout Europe.&nbsp; It
indicated the martial genius of the nation.&nbsp; It was a
spectacle to which the Englishman would point with patriotic
vanity,&mdash;just as the Roman would point, in the days of his
great heroes, to the Campus Martius, and the streets that led to
the capitol, crowded with the symbols and attendants of a triumph
decreed by the republic as a reward for the valour of her warlike
sons.&nbsp; Another prince not indeed occupying the throne, but
the loving <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>and honoured consort of the illustrious lady who fills
it, has proposed a great English festival for the year 1851, and
in union, not merely with popular members of the aristocracy but
with distinguished representatives of commercial enterprise, and
industrial activity, has sent forth the challenge to all lands,
and invited people of all ranks to an earnest rivalry for crowns
of pre-eminence.&nbsp; Thither have already arrived the weapons
with which the contest is to be decided, while multitudes are
wending from the far east and west to witness the array, to
decide on who are the winners in this strange conflict, and to
award to each the prize he merits.&nbsp; This exhibition of art
is beautifully significant of the times in which we live.&nbsp;
It shows that the taste for arms is no longer predominant; that
it has yielded to predilections more worthy of human
nature.&nbsp; Bales of merchandise and piles of manufacture are
now beginning to be deemed more worthy of regard and admiration,
than blood-stained banners, bruised shields, and splintered
spears, with other trophies torn from the vanquished.&nbsp; The
gauntlet of war is not flung down before the world, but the gage
of peace.&nbsp; To the assemblage in Hyde Park&mdash;a <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>fraternal
intermingling of the children of all lands, with their
interchange of ideas and sentiments, conveyed both to the eye and
the ear, and the healthful stimulus thus afforded to the further
improvements of the arts of human life&mdash;many of us are now
pointing, not with pride but with thankfulness to Providence, as
interpretations of the new spirit that has come over civilized
society.&nbsp; Nor can we omit to add that much as the
superiority of the military profession was vaunted in the olden
time, and strongly as may linger still in many breasts the
remnants of that prejudice, we believe that mankind are coming
more and more to see that the palm of preference belongs of right
rather to him who deepens the channels of industry, and
circulates the streams of commerce.&nbsp; To build up and adorn
must be better than to desolate&mdash;to nourish, comfort, and
gladden, than to fight and destroy; and if armies be still
needful to protect and defend, if we want them as a police to
sustain and execute the law of nations, let it be remembered that
such a view can give martial occupations no precedence in the
estimation of the wise and good&mdash;as he whose business it is
to take captive or to punish <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>the violators of public order can
never rank above those who minister directly to the happiness and
improvement of their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>Nor should we here forget the enduring character of those
peaceful victories won in modern times by discovery and
invention, of which multiplied mementoes are afforded in the
treasures of the Hyde Park Palace.&nbsp; Most favourably do they
stand out in contrast with the evanescent nature of military
power and valour.&nbsp; &ldquo;To whatever part of the vision of
modern times,&rdquo; says sir Humphry Davy, &ldquo;you cast your
eyes, you will find marks of superiority and improvement, and I
wish to impress upon you the conviction that the results of
intellectual labour or scientific genius are permanent, and
incapable of being lost.&nbsp; Monarchs change their plans,
governments their objects, a fleet or an army effect their
object, and then pass away: but a piece of steel touched by the
magnet preserves its character for ever, and secures to man the
dominions of the trackless ocean.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the
discoveries of knowledge and their application to practical uses
are of this description, and we joyfully compare them with the
mouldering trophies of the warrior.&nbsp; The <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>spoils of
Cressy and Poictiers have long since perished&mdash;even the
power which Edward and his soldiers established in France soon
declined and disappeared, and long since left behind it only a
name in history&mdash;but the results of scientific study and
artistic toil, which have produced the Great Exhibition of 1851,
are destined, we doubt not, to last to a remote period, and to
improve the condition and adorn the dwellings of unborn millions
of the human family.</p>
<p>In closing this chapter, we may remark that unlike the martial
gathering at the tournament of Windsor, the concourse of British
subjects at the present festival no longer exhibits the
distinctions of feudal society.&nbsp; Lordship and vassalage have
happily become numbered among the things that are past.&nbsp;
Whatever purposes they might subserve at a certain period, they
were badges of imperfect civilization, and have given place to a
condition of social order in which, though a graduated scale of
rank very properly obtains, the equal rights of men as
intellectual and moral beings are beginning to be
acknowledged.&nbsp; In this &ldquo;passage&rdquo; of arts,
&ldquo;not arms,&rdquo; the humblest are permitted to display <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>their
skill;&mdash;not as aforetime, when the contest was confined to
the men of high descent, the poorest workman may place his
productions beside those of the richest sons of fortune.&nbsp;
The man who can make no boast of gentle blood, who can appeal to
no roll of ancestry, whose name is but of yesterday, who simply,
by dint of using his brains and his muscles, his thoughts and ten
fingers, has raised himself into notice is permitted and
encouraged to contend with the highest born for the prize of
honour in these pacific and generous rivalries.&nbsp; This is not
among the least pleasing of the contrasts between past and
present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> invitation we have given to the
world, to send its treasures to enrich and bedeck our Crystal
Palace, and its tribes to visit us, for the sake not only of
inspecting that great emporium but of witnessing our national
conditions under its various aspects, implies a conscious
greatness, on the part of our country, sufficient to warrant such
a bold and unprecedented step.&nbsp; It would be presumptuous and
idle for an inferior state to ask her potent neighbours thus to
honour her, and no such state would venture on the
experiment.&nbsp; Indeed, the resources necessary for carrying
out <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>so
formidable an enterprise could not be at its command.&nbsp; Great
Britain, while she assumes by her present conduct a high standing
in the rank of nations, can with perfect ease justify herself in
this respect.</p>
<p>Though the mother isle be a tiny speck on the map of the
globe, her colonial dependencies extend over the most remote
latitudes.&nbsp; Her entire territory embraces an area of eight
millions of square miles, exceeding that of Russia by at least
one million.&nbsp; It is double the size of the continent of
Europe, and out of every six acres of dry land upon the planet it
claims one.&nbsp; Two hundred and forty millions of subjects bow
to the sceptre of Queen Victoria, the largest united population
in existence, next to China.&nbsp; Including the whole empire, a
fifth of the human family are subject to her sway.&nbsp; Of this
multitude, two hundred millions dwell in India; so that, if that
country only remained under British rule, her Majesty could say
to the potentates of Europe, &ldquo;I am equal to you all; for,
taking all the men on the surface of the globe, one at least out
of every six owns me as supreme.&rdquo; <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>In the amount of its revenue, the
wealth of its commerce, the activity and productiveness of its
manufactures, the intersection of its country by roads, canals,
and railways, the cheapness and rapid communication of its postal
system, and the number of ships which crowd its ports, England
knows no equal.&nbsp; Other elements of greatness which cannot be
reduced to statistic calculation are to be added to these, such
as our government, institutions, laws, liberties and
literature.</p>
<p>Dwelling upon the fact of our national greatness, so obviously
suggested to us by what is now taking place, we very naturally
pause for a moment to inquire into the causes of this
distinction.&nbsp; It is to be expected that a combination of
many influences and agencies will be found to have contributed to
the result.&nbsp; That it is really so the facts of our history
abundantly prove.&nbsp; The present state of Great Britain is, in
the first place, to be ascribed in no small degree to the
peculiar character of the races of whose offspring our population
is in the main composed.&nbsp; The thriving myriads who people
the cities, till the fields, man the vessels, and constitute or
rule the colonies of our country, are <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>descendants of robust and vigorous
Teutonic tribes.&nbsp; Saxon, Danish, and Norman were all allied,
and possessed a general resemblance in point of physical and
intellectual qualities, connected with specific differences, the
blending of which, by the intermingling of these families, could
not fail to produce very decided effects upon the character of
their posterity.&nbsp; The influence of the peculiarities
inherent in the natural constitution of different races, once
almost entirely overlooked by historians, and now liable to be
exaggerated by writers of a certain school, has stamped the
impress of its reality and power with conspicuous breadth and
vividness upon modern civilization in the contrast which exists
between the people of Teutonic and Celtic origin.&nbsp; Our
condition, in the next place, is to be attributed to the physical
peculiarities of our native land&mdash;to our climate, which
cannot have failed to affect not only our natural temperament and
health, but to some degree our mental phenomena, and to a greater
degree our social habits,&mdash;to the configuration, soil, and
geological strata of our beautiful island: its scenery giving a
certain cast and hue to the colouring of our imagination: its
rich lands <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>making us an agricultural community: its metallic and
coal mines inviting us to task our manufacturing skill: and its
vast range of coast-line, with its facilities for the erection of
ports and the construction of harbours, impelling us to engage in
maritime enterprise.&nbsp; Our condition is further to be
ascribed to our insular position, which has led us to seek the
empire of the seas, and often preserved us from being ravaged by
invaders; while it has given a stimulus to our commerce, with its
peaceful and humanizing tendencies.&nbsp; It is also to be traced
to forms of government and modes of society which prevailed
during the medi&aelig;val age, themselves springing from earlier
political and social influences that flowed from Roman and German
springs.&nbsp; It is as true of nations as of individuals, that
the child is father to the man; and old England&mdash;the England
which is&mdash;must have had its destiny in no small measure
shaped by young England&mdash;the England which has been.&nbsp;
From Roman law and usage, Saxon witenagemotes and courts of
justice, Norman baronial assemblies and tribunals, and the
welding or fusion of them together, so as to produce in some
cases a mutual interpenetration,&mdash;from <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>these has
arisen our peculiar kind of government, political and legal;
which, with all its faults, whether in principle or
administration, is an agency to which under Divine providence we
owe no small degree of our stability and power.&nbsp; The feudal
training of a partly Saxon population, through so long a portion
of the middle ages, is a fact of great importance in our history,
and of potent bearing on us even at the present hour; and it may
be worth while to notice that the modern European empires which
were bred in the feudal school&mdash;England, France, and
Germany&mdash;take decided precedence of the states to the north
and south, which grew up undisciplined by that rude but effective
process of education.&nbsp; Our condition has been further
influenced most powerfully by the history of the last four
hundred years.&nbsp; By the wars of the Roses, which weakened the
aristocracy and strengthened the throne, by the political bearing
of the Reformation, the rise and progress of the puritan party in
the state, the Civil War, and the Commonwealth under Cromwell,
all of which developed popular power, and for a while trampled in
the dust both crown and coronet.&nbsp; To all this must be added
the Revolution of <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>1688, which adjusted the relation of the three estates
of the realm, so as to secure ever since a tolerable degree of
harmony in the mutual working of principles and interests,
commonly deemed antagonistic.&nbsp; Past changes are the secret
of our present stability; the intestine wars of bygone centuries,
which shock us as we read their story, were really the harbingers
of the national peace, order, and security on which we recently
congratulated ourselves when wild revolutionary hurricanes swept
over the thrones and institutions of Europe.&nbsp; Continental
states, later in their hour of trial than ourselves, have
probably to go through somewhat similar eras of struggle yet,
before they can win the order and repose which we have received
from the veteran champions of English freedom, during the long
fight of the seventeenth century.&nbsp; And, to sum up many other
influences in one sentence&mdash;our national position and
character are to be connected with the study and experience of
our venerated forefathers&mdash;with their knowledge and wisdom,
acquired from what they read in the history of older nations, and
what they saw of modern ones&mdash;with their genius and
practical sagacity, the books they wrote, and the <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>deeds they
did&mdash;with the inventions of art, and the discoveries of
science, and the collision of sentiments, opinions, and
principles which have from time to time been freely expressed and
canvassed.&nbsp; But the most powerful agency remains to be
noticed.&nbsp; Above all, our national greatness is the result of
Christianity, which has long had a strong hold upon the hearts of
multitudes, and which has indirectly exercised a most beneficial
influence on others who have had little regard for its doctrinal
principles.&nbsp; The sternness of those German tribes from whom
we have sprung was not to be subdued; and those better qualities,
which mark us as a people, were not to be produced by any power
less than the divine power of the Gospel.&nbsp; Christianity,
during the middle ages, even under the disadvantage of working
through a corrupt church, was the main stay of social order, and
wrought out beautiful results in individual character.&nbsp; In
its reformed developments it has mainly contributed to the best
and most valued of our social improvements.&nbsp; Our noblest
heroes have been inspired by its celestial spirit; our most
precious institutions have felt the shapening touch of its divine
hand; the best portions of <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>our literature reflect the refulgence
of its light.&nbsp; And what there may be of virtue, integrity,
honour, benevolence, and piety in our land, is the offspring of
the heaven-sent truth written in the Bible.&nbsp; It is not
Christianity alone, we grant, which makes us what we are; but,
without Christianity, it is utterly impossible to imagine that
our civilization should have attained its present zenith.&nbsp;
In connexion with the working of those marvels of our
time&mdash;electric telegraphs&mdash;it has been found that when
a piece of paper has been dipped in a certain chemical solution,
a stream of electricity passed over it will imprint the paper
with beautiful tints and dyes.&nbsp; So, we may say, that if the
other events and influences we have enumerated have been like the
chemical solution to the paper, preparing our country for some
high destiny, the introduction of the gospel, and its continuance
among us, has been like the electric stream passing over the
nation, covering it with the fair and beautiful colours which
render it the admiration of the world.&nbsp; Nor should the early
period of the introduction and establishment of Christianity
amongst us be overlooked; for, if it had been delayed to a later
period, it is obvious <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>that the circumstance must have
proved exceedingly detrimental to our infant civilization.&nbsp;
That early introduction and establishment we are apt to regard as
a matter of course, though there was no anterior improbability,
in the first centuries of the Christian era, of the religious
fate of Great Britain being otherwise than that of Eastern
empires.&nbsp; Our Island might have attained a stereotyped
condition, as India and China have done, and neither received nor
craved the Great Gift of God.&nbsp; Then must our civilization
however have been correspondingly poor, imperfect, and
weak.&nbsp; The arrival of Christianity in this western corner of
the world, some seventeen hundred years ago or more, to instruct
us in divine truth, and as a loving nurse to foster and cherish
our nascent civilization, then exposed in these rough seas like
an infant in an &ldquo;ark of bulrushes,&rdquo; was the result of
a mission from Him, who is sovereign in all his ways, and who
chose us for his high purposes; not because we were &ldquo;more
in number than any people, for we were the fewest of all people,
but because the Lord loved us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reviewing the character and causes of our civilization,
it is natural to inquire what <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>will be its coming destiny.&nbsp;
However some may idly talk, our civilization is far from being
necessarily progressive.&nbsp; The history of the great powers of
the ancient world reads us admonitory lessons.&nbsp; It is very
affecting, after we have mused on Rome in her palmy pride, and
fancied we saw one of her great triumphal processions on its way
to the Capitol, so expressive of the warlike genius of the
republic, sweeping in a tide of living grandeur through the
forum, so rich in architectural splendour, to turn to a sentence
like this in Eustace&rsquo;s Tour:&mdash;&ldquo;The glories of
the forum are now fled for ever: its temples are fallen: its
sanctuaries have crumbled into dust: its colonnades encumber its
pavements, now buried under its remains.&nbsp; A herdsman seated
on a pedestal, while his oxen were drinking at the fountain, and
a few passengers moving at a distance in different directions,
were the only living beings that disturbed the solitude and
silence that reigned around.&rdquo;&nbsp; Equally affecting is it
when pondering the story of Athens, once the fairest city of the
earth, with her statues and temples and memorial tombs&mdash;her
orators, philosophers, and poets&mdash;the very home of artistic
beauty and <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>intellectual refinement,&mdash;to hear a traveller
remark, as he describes the present state of the once unrivalled
Areopagus: &ldquo;Let us wade through the crisp and bearded
barley to the Bema, whence Demosthenes was wont to
thunder,&rdquo;&mdash;and to think that where the murmur of his
vast audience was once heard no sound is awakened now but the
rustling of the ears of corn under the passing wind.&nbsp; Nor
less affecting is it to read in the old Hebrew prophet, the son
of Buzi,&mdash;who saw visions of God by the river
Chebar,&mdash;the tale of the glory and the doom of Tyre; to see
her &ldquo;situate at the entry of the sea,&rdquo; when the
builders have perfected her beauty, and all her &ldquo;ship
boards&rdquo; are of &ldquo;fir trees&rdquo;&mdash;with
&ldquo;cedars from Lebanon&rdquo; for
&ldquo;masts,&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;the oaks of Bashan&rdquo;
for &ldquo;oars&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;ivory brought out of the
Isles of Chittim&rdquo; for &ldquo;benches,&rdquo;&mdash;and
&ldquo;fine linen with bordered work from Egypt for
sails,&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;the inhabitants of Zidon and
Arrad&rdquo; for &ldquo;mariners,&rdquo;&mdash;and they of Persia
and Lud and Phut and Arrad are in her army men of war, who
&ldquo;hang their shields upon the wall;&rdquo; and the merchants
&ldquo;trade in her fairs&rdquo; &ldquo;in all sorts of
things;&rdquo;&mdash;and she is &ldquo;replenished and made <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>very glorious
in the midst of the seas,&rdquo; and her &ldquo;wisdom and her
understanding have got her riches and gold and silver,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;every precious stone is her covering,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the princes of the sea&rdquo; sit on their thrones and
wear their &ldquo;broidered garments,&rdquo;&mdash;and then to
read her doom fulfilled to the letter: &ldquo;Behold I am against
thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against
thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up, and they shall
destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers; I will
also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a
rock; it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst
of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To minds of imagination and sensibility, more sombre than
sanguine, it is not surprising that with these facts in
remembrance the future decline of this great empire should seem
probable; and perhaps by such minds a picture of its mother city
in some coming age is painted so as to resemble her precursors in
the path of grandeur and decay:&mdash;And here and there stand a
broken arch of one of her bridges, the waters idly rolling on, no
richly freighted ships upon their bosom any longer; and yonder
are her once <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>proud senate halls, a mouldering heap covered with wild
flowers, a solitude like the Roman Coliseum; and around the spot
where now the miracle of modern art is crowded by the people of
all lands, there stretches a solitary wilderness where the
traveller rambles amidst tangled grass and brushwood, and sits
down and muses in some quiet dell, left by the dried-up lake of
the Serpentine, and haunted by memories of the fall of
London.&nbsp; Calm and intelligent reflection however suggests
that there is far less of probability than poetry in such
anticipations.</p>
<p>England is not like ancient Italy&mdash;London is not the
antitype of Rome.&nbsp; On this account, in the first place, that
the whole world has changed, and especially the condition of the
western nations in reference to each other, since that memorable
night when the trumpet of the Goth was heard at the Salarian
gate, and armed hosts came rushing along the broad highway, and
the soldier flung his brand in the house of Sallust, and the
shrieks of maidens and matrons mingled with martial shouts, and
the senators saw the old tragedy under the Gauls
repeated&mdash;Rome surprised and taken.&nbsp; An empire hemmed
all <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>around
by fierce warlike tribes might be so broken down; but, in the
modern world, where are the Goths and Huns and Vandals to be
found?&nbsp; And, even if they did exist, the insular position of
Great Britain, and her maritime defences, would preserve her from
the kind of invasion which prostrated in the dust the old
mistress of the world.&nbsp; Only a great civilized power, having
large means of transport at its command, could invade our
shores.&nbsp; To succeed, it must be a nation eminent for skill
and science, as well as for other resources, considering the
ample means of defence which, by aid of electric telegraphs,
steam, and railways, the government of our country could at the
shortest notice bring to bear on the spot endangered by
assailants.</p>
<p>The contrast between Athens and England, as it regards their
dangers, is suggested in a remarkable passage of Xenophon.&nbsp;
He remarks that&mdash;&ldquo;Athens rules the sea; but as the
country of Attica is joined to the continent, it is ravaged by
enemies, while the Athenians are engaged in distant
expeditions.&nbsp; If the Athenians inhabited an island, and
besides this enjoyed the empire of the seas, they would, as <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>long as they
were possessed of these advantages, be able to annoy others and
at the same time be out of all danger of being
annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benefit of an insular position, which Athens did not
command, is possessed by England; and, as Montesquieu observes,
&ldquo;We might imagine that the Greek historian and philosopher
was speaking of our own country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Athens was finally
crushed by the Turks; but whatever apprehension there once was of
the invasion of the West by Mohammedan arms, no such apprehension
can ever be felt again; and if any likeness be traced between the
old Turkish and the present Russian Empire, the latter threatens
the East rather than Europe, and an invasion of England by an
army that must march through the German States, or by an armament
sailing from the Baltic ports, is among the wildest dreams of
fear.&nbsp; Then, going back to the fall of Tyre, under the
desolating hand of a Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander, peril like
hers, in reference to ourselves, seems next to impossible; for
the days of such conquerors are gone by for ever.&nbsp; Even the
career of Napoleon was not the counterpart of them, nor could be
in the modern state of the world, with <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>its large community of civilized,
powerful, and independent nations.</p>
<p>The danger of our country, then, is not from the invader; what
we have to apprehend in the future is discoverable in another
quarter.&nbsp; There are two obvious possibilities which demand
our attention: <i>first</i>, England may be out-rivalled.&nbsp;
The youthful vigour of America, her art and enterprize, her
intelligence, her ardent patriotism, her vast and ever-swelling
territory and population, already afford some bold and distinct
indications of her future rapid advance&mdash;the son promising
to surpass the sire.&nbsp; France and Germany, too, are full of
latent resources, and of that strong spirit which only needs
wisdom to guide it in order to their unprecedented
enrichment.&nbsp; And who can tell what Russia will be, when
thoroughly civilized?&nbsp; Looking to the universal colonial
dependencies of England, which alone can give her territorial
importance&mdash;for her insular position prevents her from
incorporating foreign domains as integral parts of her own
country&mdash;one can see the possibility of great changes in the
East: and then looking to our colonies properly so called, who
can deny the likelihood of their throwing off the leading-strings
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>some day,
not we hope without filial love for their mother state, to march
in their own strength erect along the paths of their high
destiny?&nbsp; And in Australasia, especially, there may spring
up a new England formed in the providence of God to vie with and
outstrip old England.&nbsp; There is a <i>second</i> possibility,
from the thought of which we shrink.&nbsp; Looking, on the one
hand, at the amount of immorality and irreligion which already
obtains amongst us, and at sins for which, on account of general
concurrence in them, the nation at large may be held guilty, we
have ground of alarm.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, when we take
into account the extent of Christian virtue, piety, and
benevolence to be found in our land, we recognise grounds of
hope.&nbsp; Now it cannot be denied that the latter instead of
overcoming the former <i>may</i> leave it to prevail and triumph,
and may itself decline.&nbsp; A far deeper depravation of public
morals than we have mentioned may occur.&nbsp; So much of
national truth and honour as is happily preserved may be
sacrificed to a base expediency.&nbsp; Instances of commercial
integrity may become rare.&nbsp; Domestic life and manners may
lose their present purity.&nbsp; Infidelity and superstition may
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>divide
almost all hearts between them.&nbsp; Then is the doom of the
country sealed.&nbsp; Mortals are short-sighted as to the
relative position of the different states of the world in coming
times, the forecastings of the political philosopher are in many
instances disappointed, and the prudential measures of the wisest
statesmen often fail; but this is sure, that sooner or later a
nation will fall from the throne of her greatness, when she
deserts the paths of virtue and forsakes the counsels of
God.&nbsp; The sins of a people, if not repented of, are certain
ultimately to bring down upon them Divine judgments.&nbsp; Nor
should it be forgotten, that such ascendency as ours has its
special temptations.&nbsp; Plato, in his republic, guards against
choosing for his ideal commonwealth &ldquo;such a site as by its
proximity to the sea, and other advantages for merchandise,
navigation, and naval warfare, would be liable to render the
citizens too wealthy and overbearing, and faithless in war and
peace.&rdquo; Commerce will be the mother of national virtues
when she is joined in wedlock with religion, otherwise she may be
fruitful in an abundant progeny of vice and crime.</p>
<p>Our danger, then, is internal rather than <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>external.&nbsp; And the same may be said of old Rome,
for had she been faithful and virtuous she had never fallen under
the barbarians&rsquo; sword.&nbsp; It was also true of
Greece.&nbsp; And as to Tyre, we are told on the highest
authority, &ldquo;By the multitude of thy merchandise they have
filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned:
therefore will I cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God,
and will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the
stones of fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are convinced that only vice and
impiety can ruin us, that only virtue and religion will prove our
invincible safeguards.&nbsp; Should such a general state of
depravity arise as that described by the prophet, when judgment
is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off, and truth
is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter, though no army
should land on our shores, and no foreign navy should touch our
fleets, and wealth and luxury should flow on, the curse of Heaven
would be on us, and our civilization would be corrupted to the
core.&nbsp; But let the righteousness that exalteth a nation be
ours, and then, however strong and numerous our enemies, however
prosperous and superior our rivals, the arm of <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>God would be
our shield&mdash;though surpassed we should not be dishonoured:
but the destiny of our Empire would still be onwards along the
paths of moral civilization.</p>
<p>As Christianity has contributed so greatly to raise us in the
scale of nations, so that alone can enable us to preserve our
standing.&nbsp; Our religion is as dear to hope as to
memory.&nbsp; The influence of the gospel will equally prove the
preserver of the highest good amongst us, and the sure catholicon
for the worst evils.&nbsp; Whatever plans may be devised to
improve the physical and social condition of the people, the only
remedy that can touch the moral disease in the individual man,
(and that, after all, is the root of every social mischief) must
be looked for in the truths of the Bible and the agency of the
Holy Spirit.&nbsp; No dream can be more wild and visionary, more
at variance with the ancient and modern story of mankind, than to
suppose that any changes in the government or laws of a country
will of themselves ensure the happiness and prosperity of a
nation.&nbsp; Political revolutions the most fair and promising
have often proved abortive.&nbsp; It is beyond all doubt a
righteous duty to bring the framework and <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>machinery of
our social world as near to perfection as it is possible; wise
organization is eminently subservient to a nation&rsquo;s
welfare: but our strongest and best hopes for the future security
and advancement of the English commonwealth are firmly fixed on
the personal regeneration of its members through the Divine power
of the gospel of Christ.&nbsp; Earnest, indefatigable, patient,
humble, holy endeavours for the application of that heavenly gift
to the hearts of our countrymen are in the first rank of our
social duties.</p>
<p>And looking for a moment away from home; taking in at one
broad glance the moral and religious condition of the British
empire, what awful and startling facts arrest our attention, full
of irresistible appeals to Christian consciences.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Our queen rules over more Roman Catholics than the pope,
over more Mohammedans than the Sublime Porte, and over more
pagans than the whole continent of Africa.&nbsp; If we ask,
&lsquo;What is the religion of the British Empire?&rsquo; judging
by numbers, the unhesitating reply must be, paganism.&nbsp; It
contains more Mohammedans than Christians of both names, and more
pagans than Mohammedans and Christians <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>together.&rdquo;&nbsp; These facts
are indeed voices of warning!&nbsp; What is to be expected, if
English Christians do not vastly increase their missionary
efforts in our world-wide dependencies, for whose moral and
spiritual condition we must, from the circumstance of their
dependency, be in a high degree responsible?</p>
<p>In connexion with strenuous efforts at home and in our
colonial provinces, near or remote, for the diffusion of
Christianity &ldquo;pure and undefiled,&rdquo; it is our solemn
duty to abound in &ldquo;supplication and
intercessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are sure that prayer did save
Israel, and might have saved Sodom.&nbsp; Its influence, as
revealed in the apocalyptic vision of John, is so great, that it
is seen shaping the course of history.&nbsp; Great changes
come&mdash;judgments, penal and purifying, among the
rest&mdash;as the result of prayer:&mdash;&ldquo;And I saw the
seven angels who stood before God; and to them were given seven
trumpets.&nbsp; And another angel came and stood at the altar,
having a golden censer: and there was given unto him much
incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints
upon the golden altar which was before the throne.&nbsp; And the
smoke of the incense, which came with the <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>prayers of
the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; And the angel took the censer, and filled it with
fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were
voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an
earthquake.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that &ldquo;door opened in
heaven,&rdquo; and the light from it falling on the page of our
national annals, can we doubt that Christian prayer has had
influence upon the destiny of our empire?&nbsp; Who shall unravel
all the threads of influence, knitting up men&rsquo;s hearts in
courage and heroism, which proceeded out of days of prayer and
fasting in Puritan times, and all the healing virtue brought down
by it upon a wounded and bleeding country?&nbsp; And who can tell
how much England, in her hour of need, when under James the
Second the threatening clouds of papal despotism began to gather,
was indebted for the scattering of the storm to the voice of
prayer?&nbsp; And, since then, how many critical junctures have
occurred, when results have been produced not to be adequately
accounted for by any visible cause, and therefore indicating some
other agency at work which worldly minds take no note of, but
which the devout will recognise in the wrestlings of holy <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>prayer!&nbsp;
The throne of grace, under which our fathers took refuge in times
of heavy trial must be our resort if we would preserve the
religious privileges they have handed down to us, and defend and
enlarge the vast heritage of national good which they
bequeathed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Endowed</span> as we are with a principle
of suggestion&mdash;one of the most active principles in the
human mind, ministering greatly to the pleasures of existence,
and giving to men of enlarged intelligence the means of various
and extensive gratification&mdash;it is very natural, on looking
at the great event of the present year, to cluster round it in
thought a number of facts <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>bearing in relation to it some kind
of affinity.&nbsp; Even the structure and its contents are not
without suggestive interest, while the great gatherings of the
people to behold them excites the memory and imagination, and
brings out many a picture of things that have been or that shall
be.&nbsp; Associations are suggested, commercial and classical,
romantic and religious.</p>
<p>As a simple exposition of art, the Exhibition reminds us, in
the first place, of the Expositions of Art in the French
metropolis, which at intervals have taken place during the last
fifty years.&nbsp; We go back to the times of the first republic,
when after the tragedies of the revolution, and their dire effect
on industry and commerce, it was felt that some stimulus and
encouragement were needed to revive them; and the deserted palace
of St. Cloud, under the superintendence of the Marquis
d&rsquo;Av&egrave;ze, was enriched and adorned with the
productions of a people whose tasteful ingenuity no social
disorders could extinguish.&nbsp; The walls were hung with costly
draperies from the Gobelin manufactory&mdash;the floors were
covered with rich carpets from the looms of La Savonnerie, and,
amassed in profusion and arranged with skill, <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>there was a
display of the variegated porcelain of Sevres, that hive of
curious industry which borders the spacious park of the palace we
have mentioned.&nbsp; Succeeded by a second Exposition at the
Hotel d&rsquo;Orsay, in the city of Paris, the two were regarded
by Napoleon,&mdash;who, though flushed with his early victories,
failed not to discern that war without commerce would but exhaust
his country,&mdash;as sufficient to warrant a third and greater
attempt, and accordingly the Temple of Industry, as it was
called, was reared in the Champ de Mars.&nbsp; It was of simple
construction, adorned with oriflames, and the victorious
tricolours of the first Italian campaign, and within the walls
there were exhibited for three days, some of the most beautiful
works of art the country could supply.&nbsp; The temper of that
great nation at the juncture was candidly expressed by the prime
minister: &ldquo;Our manufactures are the arsenals which will
supply us with the weapons most fatal to the British
power;&rdquo; and as we read his words we rejoice in the far
different relations of the two empires now, and the pleasant
union and amicable rivalry of our Gallic neighbours with
ourselves in the present enterprise.&nbsp; Other Expositions
followed, but the <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>ninth, under Louis Philippe, in the magnificent Place de
la Concorde, in the year 1839, eclipsed them all; and as the
gratified monarch gazed on the trophies of French ingenuity and
skill, he exclaimed, &ldquo;These are the true victories which
cause no tears to flow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor can we, while these
imposing scenes in the French capital and its neighbourhood pass
before us, forget the humble attempts made in our own country in
connexion with our valuable Mechanics&rsquo; Institutions, to
exhibit in some of our large towns, especially Manchester and
Leeds, the products of native industry.&nbsp; They are worthy of
honourable and grateful remembrance, as indications of that
indomitable and individual spirit of enterprise, which is one of
the secrets of our commercial prosperity.</p>
<p>The Exhibition is a great Bazaar.&nbsp; It is, to a
considerable extent, based on the true principle of such
establishments.&nbsp; That principle is one of classification,
and therefore the term Bazaar is incorrectly applied to certain
marts in the metropolis which are but heterogeneous clusters of
shops under a common roof.&nbsp; The original principle is a
classification of products according to the trades to which they
belong; <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>here it is a classification of products according to the
countries from which they are received.&nbsp; The Bazaar, as
essentially oriental, carries us away to Cairo and
Constantinople, to Persian towns and Indian cities.&nbsp; We find
ourselves in the crowded alley of some vaulted building, with
shops of a similar kind presenting goods of the same general
description, lining either side the way.&nbsp; Provisions, wares,
and fabrics, both mean and gorgeous, rude and ornamented, simple
and ornate, are piled or spread forth to please and entice the
passer-by, while, in some cases, the moody Turk, who sits
cross-legged amidst his stores, smoking his pipe, is so absorbed
in the enjoyment of that soporific luxury, that he seems hardly
to care about attending to the wants of his customers.&nbsp; In
Persia, we are told, the buildings are of rich appearance,
decorated with paintings, particularly under the domes, with
portraits of hunters and heroes, and pictures of animals, real or
imaginary.&nbsp; Generally in the East these markets are places
of immense resort, including the characteristics of an exchange,
a news room, a debating theatre, a promenade, and a rendezvous
for idlers.&nbsp; The gaiety of <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>oriental costume affords a marked
feature in the promiscuous assemblages, while the noise of many
voices, in various tongues and dialects, is like the echo of that
strange confusion of sounds once heard on the plains of
Shinar.&nbsp; In this respect the mixed scenes and various
languages in the Hyde Park Bazaar will be less surprising to the
Eastern visitors than to the people of the West.&nbsp; It will
seem to them the augmented and multiplied counterpart of one of
their own busy markets&mdash;a city-like mart, an immense
assemblage of shops beneath one crystal roof&mdash;and embosoming
in the midst of it a pleasure garden, with great trees, and fresh
flowers, and gushing fountains&mdash;the whole the work, as they
might think, of some of their most famous magicians.</p>
<p>The spirit of industrial activity and commercial competition
creates all these scenes, and as we trace them to their source we
cannot help noticing the desire of acquisition, one of the
original principles of human nature, which often and most
generally kindles and keeps that spirit alive.&nbsp; The desire
of gain, regulated by justice and generosity, is to be
distinguished from that love of money which is so strongly <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>reprobated in
the best of books, as &ldquo;the root of all evil;&rdquo; but it
cannot be denied that the innate acquisitiveness of man which may
be trained up into a virtue is too apt to sink down into a
vice.&nbsp; Influenced by a moral feeling, especially by those
considerations which Christianity suggests, and by those precepts
which Christianity enjoins, this principle prompts individuals to
gather only that they may prudently appropriate a befitting
portion, and generously distribute the rest; but apart from these
checks and guides, and stimulated by the sordid passions of
man&rsquo;s fallen soul, the natural tendency to acquire, in a
multitude of cases, degenerates into the sin of covetousness,
which is idolatry, and he who makes haste to be rich becomes a
worshipper of Mammon.&nbsp; Nor can we here omit to notice what a
wonderful spring of human energy; what a motive to exertion has
the material wealth of this world ever proved; how, perhaps, even
beyond the highest prizes of warlike ambition, it has more
frequently and continuously agitated the surface of society, and
moved it from its lowest depths.&nbsp; It has been like a strong
east wind sweeping over the world from the earliest ages, and
keeping <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>the sea of civilized life in constant commotion.&nbsp;
As we read the history of commerce, and think of the mercantile
cities of antiquity, Tyre, Corinth, Alexandria, and the
rest&mdash;as we trace the stream onwards through the middle
ages, by the way of Amalfi, Venice, and Genoa;&mdash;as we
descend to latter times, and touch on Amsterdam, Bruges, and
Louvain, and then come home and muse on the rise and rivalry, the
progress and changes of the great centres of commerce in our own
country;&mdash;as we pause in each place to look at the busy
traffic going on within them, to the crowded quays, the
well-stored warehouses, the mart of the trader, the shop of the
artisan;&mdash;as we see groups of merchants, mechanics, and
mariners;&mdash;as we listen to the buzz of many lips, and the
noise of unfurled sails, and vessels loosened from their
moorings, the tramp of men piling up bales of goods, the click of
the shuttle and clangour of the anvil, we have an impressive
illustration of the high estimate of that material wealth, which
it is the object of all this energetic activity to produce and
preserve.&nbsp; Percival&rsquo;s description of the pearl fishery
at Ceylon&mdash;itself a branch of most profitable traffic, and
exhibiting a scene <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>of bustle akin to that of an oriental bazaar&mdash;may
be regarded as a parable of the great world-mart we are thinking
of, and of the precious prize which the thousands who throng it
all covet to obtain.&nbsp; Several thousands of people of
different colours, countries, casts, and occupations, continually
passing and re-passing in a busy crowd: the vast numbers of small
tents and huts erected on the shore, with the bazaar or
market-place; the vast numbers of jewellers, brokers, merchants
of all colours and all descriptions, both natives and foreigners,
who are occupied in some way or other with the pearls, some
separating and assorting them, others weighing and ascertaining
their number and value, while others are hawking them about, or
drilling and boring them for future use; &ldquo;all these
circumstances tend to impress the mind with the value and
importance of <i>that object which can of itself create this
scene</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; On reading this description it suggests
another parable, a holy one from the holiest of lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant seeking
goodly pearls: who, when he hath found one pearl of great price,
went and sold all that he had and bought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Wandering far back into the regions of classic
antiquity, the finger of association points to Olympia and her
games, those Greek celebrations of which such graphic sketches
are preserved in the triumphal odes of Pindar.&nbsp; Though
&ldquo;the immediate object of these meetings was the exhibition
of various trials of strength and skill, which from time to time
were multiplied so as to include almost every mode of displaying
bodily activity, they became subservient to the interests of
genius and taste, of art and literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Statues
were reared to the memory of successful combatants, &ldquo;and
the most eminent poets willingly lent their aid on such
occasions, especially to the rich and great.&nbsp; And thus it
happened that sports, not essentially different from those of our
village green, gave birth to master-pieces of sculpture, and
called forth the sublimest strains of the lyric
muse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The scene of the Olympic Festival was
during the season a mart of busy commerce, where productions, not
only of manual but of intellectual labour, were exhibited and
exchanged.&nbsp; In this respect it served many of the same
purposes which, in modern times, are more effectually indeed
answered by the press, <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>in the communication of thoughts,
inventions, and discoveries, and the more equable diffusion of
knowledge.&rdquo; <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a>&nbsp; But these memorable institutions
are suggested to us in the way of resemblance, chiefly on account
of the vast and various concourse of persons which they
periodically attracted.&nbsp; At the time when the games
returned, the banks of the Alpheus became a centre of universal
interest, and exhibited a pilgrim population typical of a
congregated world.&nbsp; The festival &ldquo;was very early
frequented by spectators, not only from all parts of Greece
itself, but from the Greek colonies in Europe, Africa, and Asia,
and this assemblage was not brought together by the mere
fortuitous impulse of private interest or curiosity, but was in
part composed of deputations, which were sent by most cities as
to a religious solemnity, and were considered as guests of the
Olympian god.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is curious to observe&mdash;in
contrast with the inclusion of so many of the female sex in our
gathering of the nations, the circumstance illustrative of the
different position of woman in society in the old classic
world&mdash;that, with the exception of the priestesses of Ceres,
and certain virgins, <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>none but men, during the earlier
periods of Grecian history, were permitted to appear in Olympia
at the time of those national festivities.&nbsp; The history of
this remarkable institution, through the many ages in which
Greece was the pattern and mirror of artistic, intellectual, and
social civilization, exhibited that civilization in its rise,
progress, and decay&mdash;its spring-tide freshness, summer
pride, and autumnal beauty.&nbsp; There might the hand of
providence be seen, disclosing, expanding, and then folding up
forms of thought, modes of association, and habits of life, which
while they actually existed gave much of their own impress to the
foreigners who were gradually familiarized with them, and will
long continue, through the medium of their history and their
remains, to refresh the imagination, stimulate the genius,
chasten the taste, and arouse the emulation of mankind.</p>
<p>Other associations, which belonging to the medi&aelig;val ages
may be grouped together under the class of romantic, next occur
to our minds, bringing in procession before us a train of images
nearer in point of time, but more remote in point of
resemblance.&nbsp; We think of <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the rich old picturesque cities of
Europe, which sprung up, after the fall of the Roman Empire, in
Spain, and France, and Germany, and the Netherlands, a hardy and
robust offspring, born in troublous times, cradled amidst storms,
thrown on the world in infancy to take care of themselves, and
gathering, like individuals, strength and nerve and wit and
prudence from this rough and irregular sort of
training:&mdash;and forthwith the quaint-looking narrow streets
are seen crowded with flocks of foreign visitors to drive a
bargain in the bourse, or to barter their wool at the staple, or
to mingle in the amusements of some civic festival.&nbsp; And
amidst the concourse of merchants, and pedlars, and workmen may
be seen the knight and the squire, the monk and the minstrel.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Quaint old towns of toil and traffic,
quaint old towns of art and song,<br />
Memories haunt their pointed gables, like the rooks that round
them throng.<br />
Through these streets so broad and stately, these obscure and
dismal lanes,<br />
Walked of yore the master-singers chancing rude poetic
strains.<br />
From remote and sunless suburbs came they to the friendly
guild,<br />
Building nests in Fame&rsquo;s great temple, as in spouts the
swallows build.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;I beheld the pageants splendid that adorned those
days of old;<br />
Stately dames like queens attended, knights who bore the fleece
of gold;<br />
Lombard and Venetian merchants, with deep laden argosies;<br />
Ministers from twenty nations, more than royal pomp and
ease.&rdquo; <a name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, then, Venice is seen, rising out of the sea&mdash;a
&ldquo;mazy dream of marble palaces, old names, fair churches,
strange costumes, while the canals are like the silver threads,
the bright unities of one of sleep&rsquo;s well-woven
visions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within that great city&mdash;the modern
Tyre, her history full of warnings pointed at pride, cupidity,
ambition, and tyranny&mdash;are seen her merchant princes, with
strangers from other lands, &ldquo;Greek, Armenian,
Persian,&rdquo; meeting together in busy excited crowds to look
on the wares and treasures supplied by her richly freighted
ships; nor can we help glancing at the annual festival of that
commercial republic, when, to use the words of Rogers,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
fisher came<br />
From his green islet, bringing o&rsquo;er the waves<br />
His wife and little one, the husbandman<br />
From the far land, with many a friar and nun,<br />
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>And
village maiden, her first flight from home,<br />
Crowding the common ferry.&nbsp; All arrived:<br />
And in his straw the prisoner turned and listened;<br />
So great the stir in Venice.&nbsp; Old and young<br />
Thronged her three hundred bridges.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then these cities disappear, and give place to some
curiously carved chapel&mdash;a gem of architecture&mdash;within
whose dim aisles there gather groups of pilgrims from far-off
places, to pay their vows and offer their gifts at the shrine of
a popular saint.&nbsp; Walsingham and Canterbury show eager and
zealous worshippers, coming from distant towns and other lands,
to kneel with ignorant and superstitions reverence on the altar
steps, and to help by their genuflexions to deepen the
indentations on the wave-like surface of the floor.&nbsp; And
then again our thoughts wander away to Mediterranean ports, and
pilgrims are seen gathering there to go forth on a more
formidable expedition to the Holy Land, and as the vessel weighs
anchor, the old church hymn, the <i>Veni Creator</i>, chanted by
the sailors, is heard stealing over the waters, as they spread
their canvass to the wind.&nbsp; Nor can we forget that even
these gatherings, with all their superstition, folly, waste of
time, and pernicious moral influence, <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>nevertheless enlarged the circle of
human knowledge, and the domains of civilization, and corrected
errors in geography, and wore away prejudices between race and
race, and promoted the interests of commerce and navigation; and,
towards the latter part of the medi&aelig;val age, contributed,
by the knowledge which many of those who visited Rome acquired
respecting its corrupt and licentious court, to create and swell
that deep tide of anti-papal feeling which preceded the Lutheran
reformation and promoted it when it came.&nbsp; Far greater
crowds than ever are seen, in the eleventh century, embarking: in
the richly painted galleys of Genoa and Venice, on their way to
the East.&nbsp; Zeal for the Crusades was the very spirit of the
times, fanned in some instances and kindled in others by the
eloquence of Peter the Hermit.&nbsp; Europe precipitated itself
into Asia, and multitudes who marched on foot, as well as those
who crossed the Mediterranean, appeared on the plains of
Palestine.&nbsp; Rarely has our world, which has so often
witnessed the gathering of armed men, seen such a host as met the
eye of our Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion when he reached Acre.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Around <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>the city spread the camp of the besiegers, a collection
of warriors from every country in Europe, with their separate and
appropriate standards.&nbsp; The walls of the place were manned
by its resolute defenders, urging their active engines of warlike
defence.&nbsp; Beyond, at a visible distance, the powerful army
of Saladin appeared covering the hills and plains: their tents
radiating with the gorgeous colours so precious to Turkish
taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Crusades wasted an immense amount of
wealth, sacrificed human life to an awful extent, and were
productive of intense misery in various forms.&nbsp; But, as in
the case of all great gatherings of the human race for a common
purpose, the evils were in the main temporary, the good produced
permanent.&nbsp; They did on a large scale what pilgrimages did
on a small one.&nbsp; They tended to undermine the system of
feudalism and to sow seeds of liberty.&nbsp; Men were waked as by
a thunder-clap from the slumber of centuries.&nbsp; A movement
was produced in society, the impulse of which never died away,
for from that era European affairs underwent a change;
intellectual, moral, political, religious life began afresh to
throb through the Western world, and never <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>since have
men completely gone to sleep again.</p>
<p>Transported in imagination to Palestine, the eye travels from
the processions and crusades of former days to assemblages in
modern times, animated by a like spirit of superstition; and
among scenes of this kind such a picture as the following occurs
on the banks of the Jordan, by the fountain of Elisha, detaining
the fancy by its poetical interest, while, as an expression of
blind and misguided feeling improperly termed religious, it fills
with melancholy reflections the mind which has been enlightened
by true piety.&nbsp; &ldquo;I estimated the number of persons
encamped upon the plain before Jericho at 2,500, including a
singular variety of languages and costumes.&nbsp; There was
scarcely a people under heaven among whom Christianity is
professed without its representatives here.&nbsp; There were
Copts, Greeks, Armenians, Catholics, Protestants from Abyssinia,
Egypt, Asia Minor, Turkey, Greece, Malta, Italy, France, Spain,
Austria, Poland, Prussia, Russia, Great Britain, America, and I
believe all or nearly all other Christian lands.&nbsp; Cossacks
were very numerous, and were distinguished for their equipages
and <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>personal bearing among a motley assemblage, which could
hardly claim to be less than semi-barbarous.&nbsp; This was no
mean opportunity to study customs and costumes, when a walk of
two or three minutes brought under your inspection the Egyptian
dining upon an onion and a doura cake, the Syrian with his hands
full of curds, the Armenian feasting on pickled olives or
preserved dates, the Cossack devouring huge pieces of boiled
mutton, and the European and American seated around a box,
serving the purpose of a table, covered with the usual variety of
meats and drinks demanded by the pampered appetite of civilized
man.&nbsp; As it grew dark, a multitude of fires was kindled
throughout the camp and in the grove adjoining, which threw their
strong glare upon these very characteristic curious groups, and
gave the fullest effect to the picturesque scene.&nbsp; The red
caps, the huge turbans, the vast flaunting robes of striped silk
or scarlet, the coarse shaggy jacket and bag trousers of the
Cossacks, the venerable huge beards and bare feet and legs of the
orientals, all seemed part and parcel of the human beings who lay
nestled together upon the ground like domestic animals, or moved
about the illuminated area, <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>thus varying and multiplying by
every possible change of light and shade the phases and hues of
all that appears grotesque and fantastic to an eye accustomed to
the graver modes of the western world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now that a chain of rather wild but not uninteresting
suggestions has brought us to the Holy Land, other thoughts,
sacred and divine, bind us there for a while, strengthened by the
sight of many a foreign and home-born visitor among the actual
crowd, within and about the great Crystal Palace, unmistakably of
Israelitish origin, the descendants of the men who possessed the
country in her better days.&nbsp; And there, on the summit of
Moriah, stands an edifice devoted neither to war nor wealth, to
the advancement of art or to the gratification of pleasure, but
to the service of the God of the whole earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
mountain of snow,&rdquo; it seemed to the Roman Titus,
&ldquo;fretted with golden pinnacles.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, with an
attractiveness surpassing that of material beauty, it revealed
itself to the lingering eyes of large companies at their holy
feasts two thousand years ago, as they at length touched the
summit of some one of &ldquo;the mountains which stood round
about Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>They came over hill and dale,
through mountain pass and by river stream, singing the songs of
Zion, and rehearsing glorious things spoken of the city of
God.&nbsp; At many a cottage door, and village border, and city
gate, groups of Israelites young and old, with smiling faces and
beating hearts, fell into the augmenting crowd; which, as it
rolled on, resembled the &ldquo;swelling of their own
Jordan.&rdquo;&nbsp; They came &ldquo;upon horses, and in
chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts,
to the holy mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thither &ldquo;the tribes went
up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give
thanks unto the name of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was
&ldquo;little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and
their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of
Naphtali.&rdquo;&nbsp; They entered &ldquo;through the gates into
the city.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Jew from &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; met the Jew
from &ldquo;Beersheba,&rdquo; and he who dwelt &ldquo;by the
haven of ships,&rdquo; saluted his brother from &ldquo;the other
side of the river.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lover and friend, acquaintance
and &ldquo;kindred according to the flesh,&rdquo; fell upon one
another&rsquo;s necks and kissed each other.&nbsp; The old man
with his &ldquo;staff in his hand for very age&rdquo; saw
&ldquo;his children&rsquo;s children and peace upon
Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;streets <a

were full of boys and girls playing in the streets
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There was a voice of noise from the
city&mdash;a voice from the temple.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They went
up to the house of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; The priests were
&ldquo;clothed with salvation, the saints shouted for
joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The singers went before, the players on
instruments followed after, among them the damsels playing with
timbrels.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They praised his name in the dance,
and sang praise unto him with the timbrel and the
harp.&rdquo;&nbsp; They &ldquo;brought an offering and came into
his courts.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They came to the altar of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They compassed it round
about.&rdquo;&nbsp; They beheld &ldquo;the beauty of the Lord,
and inquired in his temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One year stands out in the history of those gatherings before
which every other fades.&nbsp; Then <i>our</i> passover was
slain.&nbsp; Then the day of the world&rsquo;s pentecost was
fully come, and great was the gathering.&nbsp; The multitude
without the gates who were assembled to gaze on that spectacle
before which, at its close, &ldquo;the sun was darkened,&rdquo;
saw an inscription, in the threefold language, of which there was
a pregnant meaning that Pilate little thought of&mdash;&ldquo;It
was written in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew,&rdquo; the <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>three great
languages then spoken on the earth.&nbsp; Men who had used these
languages from infancy were there.&nbsp; Representatives of the
world were there&mdash;the Roman centurion was there&mdash;Simon
the Cyrenian was there <a name="citation103"></a><a
href="#footnote103" class="citation">[103]</a>&mdash;multitudes
of the Jews were there.&nbsp; And as they deciphered that strange
writing, the various tongues in which the title of the Divine
Sufferer was expressed was a sign that in Him, the Roman, Greek,
and Israelite would find a Saviour and a Lord.&nbsp; The three
languages &ldquo;which like gold threads bind up the history of
the ancient world,&rdquo; were here beautifully entwined to tell
the teeming crowd of one for whose coming all the changes in the
story of their respective nations had, in the comprehensive
working of Divine providence, prepared.&nbsp; The cross of
ignominy, at the sight of which they shuddered, was the threshold
he must needs pass to enter his kingdom and ascend his throne,
there to sway over them a sceptre at whose touch their hearts
would bow and be rid of the burden of sin and guilt,&mdash;while
their mutual antipathies would melt away, and He <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>who had
brought them peace would make them one for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Roman, powerful but not happy&mdash;the Greek distracted with the
inquiries of an unsatisfying philosophy&mdash;the Jew bound hand
and foot with the chain of a ceremonial law,&rdquo; would find in
Christ crucified the power of God and the wisdom of God; and, in
the superscription of his accusation, read wondrous words of
&ldquo;peace, pardon, and love,&rdquo; to all the dwellers upon
earth. <a name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a></p>
<p>Seven weeks afterwards and again there was a gathering.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They were all with one accord in one place.&nbsp; And
suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.&nbsp;
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.&nbsp; And they were all filled with the
Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
gave them utterance.&nbsp; And there were dwelling at Jerusalem
Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.&nbsp; Now
when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>man heard them speak in his own
language.&nbsp; And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying
one to another, Are not all these which speak
Galil&aelig;ans?&nbsp; And how hear we every man in our own
tongue, wherein we were born?&nbsp; Parthians, and Medes, and
Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Jud&aelig;a,
and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in
Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of
Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them
speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the same day there were added unto them about three
thousand souls.&nbsp; And they, continuing daily with one accord
in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat
their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God,
and having favour with all the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then was the
beginning of that ingathering of souls which the Redeemer of the
world predicted when he uttered those amazing words: &ldquo;I, if
I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he began, and still he continues that
infinitely gracious work, in the accomplishment of which <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>he unites a
fallen and divided race together by uniting them to
himself.&nbsp; The moral world has been, as it were, riven by an
earthquake&mdash;consumed by an internal fire&mdash;and he
undertakes to reunite and restore it.&nbsp; He employs his cross
as the point around which the whole mass of regenerated humanity
is to collect: indeed, by the simple virtue of that cross, he
accomplishes the change, and constitutes it the axis on which the
&ldquo;new earth&rdquo; shall rest and revolve.&nbsp; The
attraction is invisibly going on, and the successful issue shall
be at length developed.&nbsp; To him shall the gathering of the
people be.&nbsp; They shall come not as captives, but as those
who choose his service &ldquo;to worship before him in his holy
mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The abundance of the sea shall be
converted; the forces of the Gentiles shall come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They shall &ldquo;fly as a cloud and as doves to their
windows.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The isles shall wait&rdquo; on
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ships of Tarshish first, to bring his sons
from afar.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He will gather all nations and
tongues, and they shall come and see his glory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
assemble the outcasts of Israel.&nbsp; The envy also of Ephraim
shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut
off.&nbsp; Ephraim <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex
Ephraim.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the divided world shall be made one in
a way infinitely transcending the ambitious dreams of an
Alexander or Napoleon.&nbsp; The moral dispersion, of which that
at Babel was the type, shall be reversed; men shall be united in
religion and love: and the lines of human interest, like the
radii of a circle, concentrating in spiritual obedience and the
glory of Christ, shall no longer confusedly and in strife cross
each other as they do now, and ever must, while a base
selfishness makes each man his own centre.</p>
<p>Lifted into this mood of feeling, so much loftier than that
with which we began the chapter, we cannot close without turning
a reverential gaze on other gatherings, in that state of being on
whose precincts we and all the multitudes around us every moment
tread.&nbsp; There is the gathering in the grave, &ldquo;the
silent waiting-hall where Adam meeteth with his
children.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The chief ones of the earth, the
kings of the nations,&rdquo; are &ldquo;brought down there and
the worm is spread over them, and the worms cover
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And &ldquo;there the rich and the poor meet
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The small <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>and the
great are there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who can count the sands on the sea
shore&mdash;and who can cast up the number of the dead?&nbsp;
Vast as it is already, the concourse in the great city of the
grave shall in a few short years receive accessions of myriads
more.&nbsp; The multitudes who crowd the streets of the Great
Metropolis, in their way to the Palace of Industry, and all whom
they represent in distant lands, will ere long descend to the
&ldquo;place of their fathers&rsquo; sepulchres.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This globe, as it sails round the sun, carries in its deep hold
many a costly thing; but the dust of its buried generations is a
freightage more precious than gold or silver!</p>
<p>Along with this there is the gathering of souls into invisible
realms.&nbsp; It is consonant with reason and revelation, that we
should believe in the conscious existence of minds after their
separation from the body.&nbsp; While the mortal remains are
preserved by Divine Providence for a mysterious restoration to
life at the last day, the immaterial and immortal spirit enters
into a separate condition of blessedness or woe, according to its
character in the present state of being.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lazarus
died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham&rsquo;s
bosom.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Absent <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>from the body, present with the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; The emancipated souls of all the holy dead,
through the mediation of the blessed Redeemer, are gathered
together in his immediate presence where there is fulness of joy,
and at his right hand where there are pleasures for
evermore.&nbsp; &ldquo;To that state all the pious on earth are
tending; and if there is a law from whose operation none are
exempt, which irresistibly conveys their bodies to darkness and
dust, there is another not less certain and powerful which
conducts their spirits to the abodes of bliss, to the bosom of
their Father and their God.&nbsp; The wheels of nature are not
made to roll backward, everything presses on to eternity: from
the birth of time an impetuous current has set in, which bears
all the sons of men towards that interminable ocean.&nbsp;
Meanwhile heaven is attracting to itself whatever is congenial to
its nature: is enriching itself by the spoils of earth, and
collecting within its capacious bosom whatever is pure,
permanent, and divine; leaving nothing for the last fire to
consume but the objects and the slaves of concupiscence: while
everything which grace has prepared and beautified shall be
gathered and <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>selected from the ruins of the world, to adorn that
Eternal City which hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
to shine in it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.&rdquo; <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp; And terrific is it to think that
as the multitude of the spirits of the just made perfect is thus
ever augmenting, so also is there an increase of the crowds of
fallen and lost beings in the abodes of despair.&nbsp; How many,
it is to be feared, are hastening on, by their course in this
world, not to paradise, but to prison&mdash;not to be with
Christ, but to go with Judas to their own place!</p>
<p>And beyond these scenes of awful interest there lies another
of like character, to be witnessed at the end of time by everyone
who may look at these pages, because it will be the gathering of
the whole human race.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dead which are in their
graves shall hear the voice of the Son of man, and shall come
forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sea shall give up the dead which is in
it.&nbsp; Death and Hades shall deliver up the dead which are in
them.&nbsp; The dead, small and great, shall stand before
God.&nbsp; The Son of man shall come in his glory, with all the
holy angels <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>with him.&nbsp; Then shall he sit on the throne of his
glory.&nbsp; And before Him shall be gathered all nations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; To think of all the multitudes who have ever
lived upon the earth&mdash;all who are now in heaven or
hell&mdash;all who are existing like ourselves&mdash;all who are
yet to be born, assembled before the judgment-seat of
Christ!&nbsp; No such an aggregate of human beings can have ever
met before.&nbsp; Compared with that final one, even regarded
simply in reference to numbers, every other assemblage fades into
insignificance.&nbsp; The solemn incidents of that day, relating
merely to the material globe and the works of men, as predicted
in the New Testament; the melting of the elements and the burning
of the earth really appear, upon reflection, less startling and
impressive than the vast concourse of mortals which shall then be
seen.&nbsp; And, to add to the wonder, all, with the exception of
those who will be alive at the coming of the Son of man, shall
have passed through mysterious stages of existence, through the
hour of dissolution and the disembodied state, and shall bring
with them to the great tribunal some <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>knowledge of the secrets of
eternity.&nbsp; Something anticipative of their future and
everlasting state they shall have experienced; so that, not in
suspense, but with certain hope or fixed despair, shall they meet
their God.&nbsp; They will have learned long before, that their
moral history in this world had determined their eternal history
in the next: that if not twice born here below&mdash;born of the
Spirit as well as of nature&mdash;they must then die &ldquo;the
second death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thoughts and emotions, remembrances
and expectations, such as in none of the world&rsquo;s great
gatherings have been or ever shall be known, will then be
felt.&nbsp; And, to complete this, the most affecting of all the
associations which our subject has suggested, the mind passes on
to contemplate the purpose and issue of the whole.&nbsp; Placed
before the great white throne, every man&rsquo;s work shall be
made manifest, the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed, that
the rectitude of the judge may be seen in his final sentence of
life or death.&nbsp; No human adjudication can be comparable to
that.&nbsp; &ldquo;Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God
Almighty; just and true art thou in all thy ways, thou King of
saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>The
brightest of all visions next unfolds.&nbsp; A structure of
peerless beauty rises above the ruins of the world, and within
its gates there gather men from all lands, select but
innumerable.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth:
for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and
there was no more sea.&nbsp; And I John saw the holy city, New
Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a
bride adorned for her husband.&nbsp; And I heard a great voice
out of heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle of God is with men,
and he will dwell with them, . . . and be their God.&nbsp; And he
showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem: and her light was
like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear
as crystal; and had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates,
and at the gates twelve angels . . .&nbsp; And the twelve gates
were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the
street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent
glass.&nbsp; And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the
moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and
the Lamb is the light thereof.&nbsp; And the nations of them that
are saved shall walk in the light <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>of it: and the kings of the earth do
bring their glory and honour into it.&nbsp; And the gates of it
shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night
there.&nbsp; And they shall bring the glory and honour of the
nations into it.&nbsp; And there shall in no wise enter into it
any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination,
or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s
book of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here let the reader lay down the book, and in devout silence
muse on these &ldquo;four last things.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Possessed</span> as we are of an aptitude
and an inclination to speculate on the issues of any enterprise
in which we take a lively interest, we naturally turn, when
revolving in our thoughts the subject of our Glass Palace and our
great gathering, to look at the consequences which seem likely to
emanate from such a remarkable exhibition, or which may be
elicited by wisdom and benevolence from the fact of such an
assemblage of the human family.&nbsp; There are <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>temporal
results of an advantageous kind certain, or almost certain, to
arise.&nbsp; While we deprecate the all-absorbing interest felt
by too many in pursuits terminating upon our condition in the
present life; while we condemn an extravagant and idolatrous
admiration of talent in invention and cleverness in contrivance;
while we deplore that in the present day there is, in some
quarters, an unmingled enthusiasm about such matters, which
almost looks like the worship &ldquo;of the vice, the saw, and
the hammer;&rdquo; while we look with pain upon the instances
around us, in which our fellow-creatures are under the supreme
and disastrous guidance of what an inspired teacher calls the
&ldquo;lust of the eye and the pride of life;&rdquo; while we
bear in mind that the insatiable love of gain, which is obvious
enough in this commercial age, and is plainly the besetting sin
of multitudes, must lead its subjects into temptation and a
snare, and many hurtful lusts, which drown men in
perdition:&mdash;yet, consistently with all this, in strict
accordance with the spirit of our holy religion, which has
&ldquo;the promise of the life that now is and of that which is
to come;&rdquo; we look with interest and thankfulness upon all
<a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>that may
improve, elevate, and adorn the condition of mankind in the
present stage of existence.&nbsp; It seems impossible that this
exposition of the works of all countries should not have a most
favourable influence upon the taste, knowledge, convenience, and
physical welfare of mankind.&nbsp; Whilst the sight of so many
productions of art will exercise the judgment, inspire the
admiration, and chasten and guide the sensibilities of the mind
in reference to artistic beauty, we shall obtain an enlarged
acquaintance with modern inventions, and thus derive information
relative to what forms an interesting chapter in the history of
human achievements.&nbsp; Among the suggestions of philosophical
and philanthropic minds, that of Douglas, for the establishment
of a Great Society, which should survey the compass and collect
and arrange the treasures of human knowledge, a suggestion
founded on Lord Bacon&rsquo;s germinant idea of a <i>philosophia
prima</i>, is one of the most remarkable.&nbsp; The Great
Exhibition will accomplish to a considerable extent one of the
ends contemplated in the project.&nbsp; It will convey more
intelligence, in reference to art, than any written description
could do.&nbsp; The operations of <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>our &ldquo;Regent Society&rdquo;
will furnish a gigantic catalogue of the inventions of men,
illustrated by the inventions themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Few
works,&rdquo; says the writer we have named, &ldquo;would be more
conducive to further advancement than &lsquo;a
calendar;&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;here he uses Bacon&rsquo;s
words;&mdash;&ldquo;than a calendar resembling an inventory of
the estate of man, of all inventions which are now extant, out of
which doth naturally result a note what things are yet
impossible, or not invented.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we shall have the
very thing&mdash;the huge household book of the world&rsquo;s
furniture, bound in covers of crystal.&nbsp; By its influence on
the knowledge and cultivation of art the Exhibition will promote
at once our individual enjoyment, the comforts of our home, and
all the conveniences and elegancies of domestic life, and also
tend to strengthen and elevate our national importance.&nbsp;
What will benefit the rich may bless the poor.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
discoveries which are the property of the higher class in one age
descend indeed to the lower, but slowly and imperfectly; and
there is ample opportunity and scope for accelerating the general
diffusion of knowledge and inventions among all classes of <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>society.&nbsp; Even, in the most civilized countries,
the mass of the nation have been suffered to remain comparatively
barbarous; and it will be the dawn of a new and happier era, when
the condition of the multitude is considered with that interest
which is due to those, the sum of whose joys and sorrows are to
all that is felt by the rest of the community what the ocean is
to the drops of rain that fall into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be difficult to point out any branch of art
which does not tend to the prosperity of our country; those which
in appearance are most remote in their influence, however
indirectly, yet effectually contribute to the perfection of its
manufactures.&nbsp; The pursuits of immediate utility and of
refined pleasure, however far separated from each other, alike
combine in exalting our national welfare.&nbsp; It is not
necessary, in recommending the fine arts to public patronage, to
point out how far they improve and recommend to other nations the
productions of manufactures, since they have higher and more
direct claims upon the national encouragement.&nbsp; Still their
advancement, and above all their diffusion, become of high
importance in a country like Britain, to be and <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>ever to
continue the centre and heart of trade and manufactures.&rdquo;
<a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a></p>
<p>We may also advert for a moment to the connexion of the
present enterprise with the pursuits of science.&nbsp; In the
history of human progress it may indeed be remarked that art has
preceded science; that Phidias came before Aristotle, and Michael
Angelo before Lord Bacon; but still science has ever proved the
friend of art in those branches which minister immediately to the
enjoyments of mankind.</p>
<p>Scarcely any specimens of modern ingenuity could be found in
the Exhibition which are not indebted for something of their
beauty and adaptation, if not their very existence, to scientific
knowledge.&nbsp; The practical application of philosophy has
given birth to the manifold kinds of machinery which at once
abridge the toils and improve the products of human skill.&nbsp;
Now art, if it cannot pay back the debt it owes to science, may
be subservient to the interests of its patron.&nbsp; So it has
proved in many instances already, and will continue to do, no
doubt, as the necessities of artistic invention give an impulse
to philosophical inquiry.&nbsp; The <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>manufacture of watches long since
led to careful observations upon the effect of temperature on
metals.&nbsp; Glass-making, at an early period, occasioned
examinations into the colouring properties of metallic oxides;
and the dying of woollens and silks has naturally induced persons
employed in that department to investigate the qualities of
mineral substances as they bore upon the operations of their own
trade.&nbsp; No sagacity can anticipate, no fancy conceive, the
yet future enlargement of the sum of human science, especially in
its minute details, to be derived from the busy activities of
useful art.&nbsp; All this the present collection of the industry
of the nations will be likely to promote; and, even with this
limited view, one may regard it, in its relation to the
Illustrious Personage who may be deemed the founder of the Great
Institute, as worthy of a place among the &ldquo;<i>Opera
Basilica</i>&rdquo; which Bacon desired to witness.&nbsp; Some
princes have sought to immortalize themselves by war; some by
purchasing the praise of contemporary poets; some by erecting
palaces, temples, and statues: but at length a prince has arisen,
who, to his lasting honour, seeks, by encouraging a noble
enterprise, to <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>foster the arts and manufactures, not only of his
adopted country but of the wide world.</p>
<p>But the social effects of the great gathering are most
important.&nbsp; Vast multitudes of the human race cannot be
brought together for one common peaceful purpose without its
tending to some desirable end.&nbsp; There is a bond of
consanguinity which encompasses all the descendants of
Adam.&nbsp; &ldquo;God has made of one blood the families of
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are sympathies in all human hearts like
the strings of a concert of harps attuned in harmony: &ldquo;as
in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When men are marshalled under opposite banners in the
battle-field, and taught to look on each other as <i>natural</i>
enemies, deadly passions are evoked from the depths of the
heart:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like warring winds, like flames from
various points<br />
That mate each other&rsquo;s fury, there is nought<br />
Of elemental strife, were fiends to guide it,<br />
Can mate the wrath of man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when they meet amidst scenes of peace, to contemplate the
glories of nature, or the beauties of art; where they are freed,
for a while at least, from the sophistry which would <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>persuade
them that the depression of one class or country is necessary to
the prosperity of another; the kindly instincts of the human
breast are likely to unfold and operate, and mutual amity and
good-will to brighten and bless the interview.&nbsp; We know how
the selfishness, pride, and irritability of men, after having for
a season been lulled to rest, may easily be aroused again: we are
not unmindful of the possibility that, even through the
Exhibition itself, jealousies may be excited in some minds; yet
still we cannot but hope, and we fervently pray, that after this
peaceful congress of states, and the amicable interchange of kind
thoughts and good offices which generally, we trust, it will
produce, there will be far more even than at present an
indisposition for war among the nations of the earth.&nbsp; May
we not expect that, after this, America, the continental powers,
and ourselves will feel an increased reluctance to unsheath the
sword?&nbsp; Will not fighting look more than ever like
fratricide?&nbsp; It was a custom among the Romans to split in
two, and divide between themselves and foreign visitors who
shared their hospitality, a small token called the <i>tessera
hospitalis</i>, which was preserved from <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>generation
to generation in the two families who formed the friendly
alliance.&nbsp; It became an heir-loom, to be enjoyed and used by
remote descendants.&nbsp; Fervently do we desire that the result
of the great gathering in the industrial mansion, the minor
gatherings in other, and especially sacred, places of resort, and
the private gatherings of foreign friends around English-hearths,
will be like the division of the <i>tessera hospitalis</i> in old
times, and that its memory will be cherished and honoured through
years to come.</p>
<p>It cannot be supposed that men should meet together from such
different quarters without enlarging their knowledge of each
other, of human nature, and the world.&nbsp; Narrow and
contracted modes of thought on certain subjects incident to very
circumscribed travelling will, we may expect, expand into
generous dimensions, in consequence of a visit from afar to the
British Metropolis; while the opportunities afforded us for
intercourse with foreigners cannot but bring the knowledge of
their methods of life and social habits to our very doors.&nbsp;
By those who are skilled in the languages of other countries the
means of improvement <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>afforded this year are great beyond
expression.</p>
<p>May we not add, that the intelligent observation of our
country, its large freedom, its general order, its civil
institutions, its commercial activity, and, above all, its
numerous benevolent associations, will be adapted to suggest
valuable hints and reflections to strangers; by creating
comparison between what they witness here and what they have been
familiar with in their own land, and by leading them to inquire
into the causes of difference between themselves and us?</p>
<p>These are probable beneficial results of the Exhibition; there
are still more important advantages to be contemplated among the
things that are possible, the actual realization of which must
depend upon combined and individual effort.&nbsp; Whether, in a
moral and religious point of view, it will terminate in blessing
the world and ourselves must be determined by the use we resolve
to make of it.&nbsp; England has created an unprecedented
opportunity for doing spiritual good on a large scale to the
other countries of the earth.&nbsp; A field of usefulness at home
is now opened, which may, by careful tillage, <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>yield a
harvest to be reaped by multitudes who shall return rejoicing,
&ldquo;taking their sheaves with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one can
tell where the undulations of the influence will terminate which
the Christians in Britain may now put in action.&nbsp; Evils
relating to the interests of morality and religion will no doubt
be incidentally occasioned by this vast concourse.&nbsp; Monsters
in human form, who seek &ldquo;the wages of iniquity,&rdquo; by
pandering to the gratification of sensuality and intemperance,
will make the months of our world-festivities the season for
plying all the bewitching arts of their deadly craft.&nbsp; They
will spread their toils with the utmost cunning, dress up
profligacy and vice in the most gorgeous apparel, and deck their
&ldquo;chambers of death&rdquo; with surpassing luxuries.&nbsp;
The strange woman will &ldquo;sit at the door of her house, in a
seat in the high places of the city, to call passengers who go
right on their ways,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;lead her guests to the
depths of hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The harpies who live by the
intemperance of others will not be slow in making provision for
temptation, where the dissipated may &ldquo;stretch themselves
upon their couches,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chant to the sound of the
viol, and drink wine in bowls <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>and anoint themselves with the chief
ointments.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gambling-house keeper will be also on
the alert, to stimulate and keep alive a feverish avarice, or to
excite some desperate attempt to repair an already ruined
fortune.&nbsp; In all these ways, and many more, evil agencies
will be busy, even beyond their common wont, to seduce the
innocent, to kindle passions impure and vile in the breasts of
the unsuspecting, and to rouse afresh the palled appetite and the
jaded desires of the man hackneyed in the ways of sinful
pleasure.&nbsp; Incentives to the breach of the sabbath will also
be contrived; facilities for amusements and excursions on the day
of rest will be multiplied; pleasure-gardens will be opened with
new attractions; and steam-boats will ply, and omnibuses travel,
in augmented numbers.&nbsp; The Sunday press will, we fear, start
on a fresh race for the favour of the worst portion of the
public, by supplying more stimulants than ever to a vitiated and
diseased taste; and other publications of vicious tendency will
be industriously vended.&nbsp; Against all these dangers we warn
the reader.&nbsp; If the young and unexperienced, when they visit
the metropolis under common <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>circumstances, need to be on their
guard against the designs of the profligate and unprincipled,
with more than double force does that necessity press upon them
at the present season.&nbsp; A much more than usual share of
caution, wisdom, self-control, and virtuous presence of mind will
be requisite, in order to preserve the visitor from falling a
prey to such as &ldquo;lie in wait to deceive.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
let every youth, whose piety has been formed amidst quiet
sequestered scenes, and has till now been sheltered by parental
care, and quickened and trained by domestic example and
instruction, seek, as he comes within the reach of new and
unknown temptations, the special protection of Divine Providence,
and the holy safeguard of the Spirit of God.&nbsp; Carefully
should he strive to fortify himself against peril, by fixed and
frequent meditation on the precepts and principles of the gospel;
and, above all, it becomes him earnestly and often to present to
God that memorable prayer, &ldquo;Hold up my goings in thy paths,
that my footsteps slip not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though mischiefs may be anticipated, yet it appears to us
a vast preponderance of moral and religious benefit may be
accomplished, <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>if British Christians rise up to the spirit of the
great occasion, and seek, under the blessing of God, to turn it
to that valuable account which Divine Providence seems now to
suggest to thoughtful minds.&nbsp; We repeat, that England has
created for herself an unprecedented opportunity for doing
spiritual good: and we may add that her guilt will be indeed
heavy if she neglect to improve it.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The great gathering supplies singular facilities for
making religious impressions on the minds of our foreign
visitors.&nbsp; As a preliminary to this, indeed an indispensable
prerequisite, we must be careful to show them courtesy and
kindness.&nbsp; It was held to be a religious duty among the
Greeks to give friendly entertainment to a stranger, because it
was believed he might possibly be a god in disguise.&nbsp; An
inspired pen enforces the duties of hospitality, on the ground
that &ldquo;some have entertained angels unawares.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We look for no such guests; but we are assured that, whatever be
their costume, clime, and speech, they who visit us are indeed
souls of Divine origin and enduring existence; and the dignity of
their nature is a sufficient reason why we should &ldquo;honour
all men.&rdquo;&nbsp; A <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>sedulous and constant endeavour to
treat them, wherever they meet us, with marked respect, and with
affectionate civility&mdash;to answer their questions, to guide
their way, and to assist their examinations into objects of
interest:&mdash;not to do this in a careless manner, but so as to
exhibit that true politeness which is described as
&ldquo;benevolence in little things,&rdquo; will tend to secure
for us a vantage ground in all the direct attempts we may make
for their spiritual welfare.&nbsp; It will bespeak their friendly
regards; it will be on the surface of our character a beautiful
proof of the practical nature of our religion, and will recommend
to candid inquiry the principles from which it springs.&nbsp; A
proud, an indifferent, a suspicious, an antagonistic, or even a
patronizing air of intercourse&mdash;(one or other of which
habits, or all in turn, some Englishmen are prone to display when
travelling abroad)&mdash;will at once alienate from us the people
of other lands, and prevent the success of our well-meant
efforts, however vigorously employed, for their spiritual
good.&nbsp; We must look on them not as inferiors, not as
individuals worse taught than we&mdash;nor as ignorant or
foolish&mdash;but as men of like passions and powers, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>having
heads as clear and hearts as warm as our own.&nbsp; This
propitiation of their favour is in a high degree important; and
if, in the impetuosity of religious zeal, it be disregarded, the
high purpose planned will be removed beyond the probability of
accomplishment.</p>
<p>To secure great spiritual results, both combined and
individual action are requisite.&nbsp; The Bible Society has
devised its methods for supplying foreigners with the word of
life in all languages.&nbsp; Means will be furnished for sending
home many a sojourner amongst us, like him of Ethiopia, who
returned from Jerusalem &ldquo;sitting in his chariot, and
reading the prophet Esaias.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, if he should
receive a favourable impression of our civilization, as we hope
he will, and be led to see that its chief excellences are based
upon the influence which the holy book has wrought in English
society&mdash;as we trust he may&mdash;then will he be thereby
prepared, in some degree, to search out the blessed contents of
that volume which unfolds the promise of the &ldquo;life that now
is, and of that which is to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Tract Society
has also religious publications in various tongues for cheap sale
or gratuitous distribution.&nbsp; And <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>perhaps when prejudice, or an
indisposition to afford sufficient time, may interfere with the
reading of the Scriptures, a tract may obtain a perusal, and drop
into the mind some germinant thoughts which may grow and ripen
into the strength and beauty of spiritual life.&nbsp; A special
organization, moreover, has been contrived to secure places of
worship for &ldquo;devout men out of every nation under
heaven,&rdquo; and to provide preachers in foreign languages, to
conduct earnest evangelical ministrations.&nbsp; And is it too
much to suppose that when they hear, &ldquo;every man in his own
tongue wherein he was born,&rdquo; the &ldquo;wonderful works of
God,&rdquo; there will be some, who, like those assembled on the
day of Pentecost, will be pricked to the heart, and will receive
the word.&nbsp; And let it not be forgotten that &ldquo;the
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for
they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because
they are spiritually discerned;&rdquo; and moreover that this
spiritual discernment is one of the &ldquo;gifts for men,&rdquo;
which an ascended Saviour gives in consequence of his having
&ldquo;led captivity captive.&rdquo;&nbsp; The written letter is
not &ldquo;the power of God <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>unto salvation,&rdquo; save as the
Spirit takes &ldquo;of the things of Christ,&rdquo; and shows
them unto us.&nbsp; Seeds of truth will not produce &ldquo;them
thirty, sixty, or a hundredfold,&rdquo; till the Lord give the
increase.&nbsp; There can be no pentecost without an effusion of
the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; But, while we feel the necessity, we should
by faith and prayer honour him who has promised the supply.&nbsp;
God is willing to do his part, if we do ours.&nbsp; &ldquo;Prove
me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you
the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there
shall not be room enough to receive it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But associated efforts will not suffice.&nbsp; Isolated action
was everything once.&nbsp; Combined action is too exclusive
now.&nbsp; The one must be done, and the other not left
undone.&nbsp; Each man must strive in his own sphere to do good
to the stranger from a far land.&nbsp; He may distribute tracts,
he may guide to the house of prayer, he may know how to drop a
fitly spoken word; or he may be able to introduce the foreigner
to a courteous, intelligent, and educated friend.&nbsp; Persons
of wealth and influence, and especially such as, together with
these, have tolerable facility in the use of modern <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>languages,
possess talents for usefulness at the present time, the value of
which they can hardly overrate.&nbsp; By judicious hospitality;
by making a point of cultivating acquaintance with the guests of
the nation, and selecting certain among them as guests of the
family; by frequent and wise arrangements for this purpose; by
entertainments, elegant but simple, generous but not extravagant;
and, by methods easily understood and adopted by those who
possess the requisite means, many may be brought within the reach
of the gentle, tender, and softening influences of Christ&rsquo;s
blessed religion of friendship and love&mdash;may have images
painted in their memory never to fade, and emotions kindled in
their hearts never to be quenched, and</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oft,
while they live&mdash;<br />
In their own chimney nook, as night steals on,<br />
With half-shut eyes reclining,&mdash;oft methinks<br />
While the wind blusters and the pelting rain<br />
Clatters without, shall they recall to mind<br />
The scenes, occurrences they meet with here,<br />
And wander in Elysium.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They may discover that they were entertained by angels
unawares.&nbsp; Elements of piety, like rich odours, may steal
over their soul, to leave <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>behind an undying fragrance.&nbsp;
Our Christianity, through our kindness, may become
endeared.&nbsp; In the reminiscences of future years they may
strangely feel that never were they so near heaven, as during the
memorable moments they spent around the domestic hearths, and at
the domestic altars of England; and, stimulated by the
recollection, they may embrace the truths and find the inward
hidden life which will enable them to perpetuate and multiply
such hallowed scenes.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The great gathering affords an argument for making
efforts to promote religion at home, and presents an opportunity
for the purpose&mdash;&ldquo;We are a spectacle to the
world!&rdquo;&nbsp; The supreme Governor of the nations, the
Prince of the kings of the earth, has assigned us a rank amongst
the empires of the globe which cannot fail to attract the
attention of mankind.&nbsp; Our constitution and laws, our
literature and science, our commerce and art, our army and navy,
present points of interest, forms of grandeur, specimens of
activity, and developments of power, which the other cultivated
portions of our race intelligently study as great theorems in the
science of civilization; while our brethren <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>in distant
regions, still half barbarous, gaze on the signs of our glory, or
listen to the tale of what we are and do, with a vacant and
bewildering kind of wonder.&nbsp; And moreover the people,
institutions, and language of this little isle have attained a
sort of ubiquity.&nbsp; They are seen, felt, heard, in almost
every latitude of both hemispheres.&nbsp; Something or other
British, some foot-marks of our wide-spread influence, may be
discovered on nearly every shore.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are a spectacle
to the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Christians of our
country&mdash;embracing the true disciples and servants of
man&rsquo;s Divine Redeemer, commissioned by his express mandate,
and constrained by his infinite love&mdash;have united and are
still employed in the sacred task of teaching to the ends of the
earth the blessed name of him they worship and adore.&nbsp; They
send the missionary, the Bible, and the tract, to the pagan
people of the world&rsquo;s two continents, and to them that
&ldquo;are afar off upon the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are a
spectacle to the world!&rdquo;&mdash;rendered so by Providence,
accepting and maintaining the position by our secular and still
more by our sacred enterprises, we more emphatically than ever
assert the publicity of the <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>post we occupy, by now inviting the
inhabitants of the world at large to visit our land.&nbsp; As a
professedly Christian nation, then, glorying as we do in that
title&mdash;making a boast very often of the purity of our
religion, of the reformation of old corruptions, and the
brilliant beauty of its spiritual truths, &ldquo;what manner of
persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and
godliness?&rdquo;&nbsp; England should be the model nation for
the world.&nbsp; Will not some strangers come, almost expecting
to find us such?&nbsp; Will they not look for striking
indications of the influence among ourselves of that Christianity
which we preach to them as worthy of all acceptation?&nbsp; Will
they not inquire, what is it doing for us?&nbsp; And we do not
fear but the intelligent and candid among them will recognise not
a few of the beautiful footprints of our religion in our
institutions and our homes.&nbsp; But will they not see something
else?&nbsp; Will they not mark, here and there, broad spaces in
our civilization where the power of our Christianity has never
come&mdash;spaces in society left uncivilized?&nbsp; We need not
now point them out; they have been laid bare again and again, and
urged on our <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>notice by home missionaries and city missionaries, by
magazines, newspapers, and parliamentary records.&nbsp; They have
met our eyes and made us shudder, in revelations from the press,
the pulpit, and the platform.&nbsp; Terrible secrets have been
divulged respecting some departments of English life.&nbsp; Facts
have been stated indicative of the vice and irreligion of some
portions of the community.&nbsp; Meditating on these things, we
seem to hear, from the lips of the foreigner whose spiritual
welfare we contemplate, those well-known
words&mdash;&ldquo;Physician, heal thyself; whatsoever ye have
done in Capernaum do also in <i>thy</i> country.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
the just retort makes us blush&mdash;not indeed for our
Christianity, but for ourselves.&nbsp; Our Christianity, wherever
it has been purely taught and faithfully applied, has wrought
marvels on a scale fully proportioned to the extent of our
efforts.&nbsp; What makes us ashamed is, that we have not
discharged our duty in reference to its diffusion among
ourselves, any more than we have done our duty in reference to
its diffusion throughout the world.</p>
<p>The presence of so many foreigners, whom we virtually
challenge to come and inspect the <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>working of our Christianity, does
not really <i>increase</i> our obligation, does not bind us more
than we were previously bound, to promote the religious interests
of our own countrymen; but surely it should powerfully
<i>remind</i> us of our obligation, should press it on our
conscientious regard, should awaken us from our slumbers, should
stimulate us now vigorously to do what ought to have been done
long before.&nbsp; While we see so much in our great towns and
rural districts to pain and humble us in the sight of men, much
more ought we to be pained and humbled in the sight of God.&nbsp;
The observation of mortals is trifling compared with his.&nbsp;
Their reproach a light matter placed beside his
condemnation.&nbsp; For years has the eye of him who watched over
ancient Israel to see what they were doing with his truth,
whether they obeyed or dishonoured it, whether they taught its
doctrines and precepts to the young and ignorant, or left them
uncultivated, a prey to unbelief, to superstition, or false
philosophy&mdash;for years has that eye been looking on English
Christians and noting down their culpable neglect.&nbsp; Happy
will it be for us as individuals now, and for our country in all
coming times, if the great event <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>of the present year should excite a
prevalent attention to the remaining spiritual necessities of the
kingdom&mdash;if it should give an impulse to our schools, our
churches, and our missions.&nbsp; That is among the possible
advantages to be reaped; and earnestly is every Christian reader
who may glance at these pages implored to take up, and ponder,
and carry out practically, with diligence, zeal, love, and
prayer, the hints imperfectly suggested, that so the year may be
signalized by an exhibition of Christian devotedness to the work
of religiously benefiting our countrymen, for which we shall have
the approbation of our Divine Lord, the testimony of a good
conscience, and the grateful remembrance of posterity, who will
&ldquo;rise up and call us blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time the assemblage of many persons from the
provinces in London this summer, affords an opportunity, an
unprecedented opportunity, for attempting, in a humble and devout
spirit, something bold, significant, and generally attractive of
attention, with a view to the spiritual good of the
multitude.&nbsp; Let thousands upon thousands of appropriate
religious publications be cheaply sold or freely given to <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>the crowds
about the park, and the streams of passengers flowing through the
principal thoroughfares.&nbsp; And let the gospel be preached by
well-known, accredited, intelligent, and earnest-minded men, in
the spirit of the preachers in the day of Pentecost, not in
spacious buildings only but in the open air, wherever it can be
done with propriety;&mdash;judicious arrangements being made for
the purpose, that holy and apostolic zeal may not, without
prejudice and misrepresentation, be regarded as ignorant and rash
enthusiasm.&nbsp; The enterprise is commenced.&mdash;Exeter Hall
has been engaged for public services on the Lord&rsquo;s day
through several months&mdash;preaching out of doors is also
contemplated.&nbsp; The initiative taken, let others follow up
the work, till London and its environs be pervaded with the light
and power of the gospel.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A <span class="smcap">century</span> ago London was thrown
into excitement by the shock of an earthquake.&nbsp; In the
streets, and for six miles round the city, slight undulations
were plainly perceptible.&nbsp; Houses were shaken, so that parts
of them fell down; and ships in the river Thames were loosened
from their moorings.&nbsp; Numbers of the terrified <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>inhabitants
flocked into Hyde Park, which, being a vast area unencumbered
with buildings, was supposed to afford a less perilous position
for the people than they could find elsewhere, in the event of
their being overtaken by the dreaded catastrophe.&nbsp; Whitfield
happened to be in London at the time, when the minds of the
citizens were agitated by intense and distracting fears; and with
an eloquence, which was surpassed only by his zeal, endeavoured
to improve the terrific event by making it the occasion of
appropriate religious appeals.&nbsp; One night he addressed a
vast concourse in the Park, and while the people pressed together
to hear him under the open sky&mdash;and the silence of the
scene, the bright stars overhead, the dim shadow of the speaker,
like some impalpable visitant come on a warning mission from the
other world, and the occurrence which had brought them together
contributed to the effect of his discourse,&mdash;he with his
almost superhuman voice which with mysterious intonations rolled
into men&rsquo;s ears, and moved their hearts as with an
earthquake, described to them the terrors of the last day, and
exhorted them to flee from the <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>wrath to come.&nbsp; Could a
Whitfield now, in 1851, gather around him in the same spot the
concourse attracted there under such different circumstances, he
might with a little exercise of his ingenious powers of
adaptation, with a slight effort of his talent for extracting
spiritual lessons from passing incidents, address his auditory on
duties of infinite moment, taking as a suggestive text one of the
bearings of the festival of art already noticed in these pages;
namely, its hopeful tendency to produce reconciliation and peace
among the nations of the world.&nbsp; We can fancy such a
preacher at the quiet hour of eventide&mdash;the sky, clear
azure, with a few fleecy clouds&mdash;the emerald-like tree-tops
bathed in the rays of the setting sun, and scarcely moved by the
gentle air&mdash;all nature seeming to repeat the angel&rsquo;s
song, &ldquo;on earth peace, good-will toward men;&rdquo; we can
fancy him lifting up his voice to tell the crowd, softened and
soothed by surrounding influences, that professing as they do to
meet in national friendship, and to celebrate a feast of
brotherly love, there are some other obligations to peace and
reconciliation which come still nearer to their homes and
hearts.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Failing the preacher&mdash;apart from the helpful
influence of the scene imagined&mdash;and debarred the aid of
that sympathy which thrills through a crowd when touched by the
living voice of a loving fellow-man, we would attempt for a
moment, through the medium of this little book, to enforce on the
individual reader two methods of improving the present event
suggested on slight reflection.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The professed character, and what we fain hope to be
the spirit, of the gathering, suggest a duty which concerns us in
our domestic relations.</p>
<p>Men, some of them not long ago, in arms against each other, we
see now on terms of amity.&nbsp; Perhaps the Austrian meets in
the park the Italian he has faced in the field&mdash;the Turk,
the Egyptian at whom he aimed his scimitar&mdash;the veteran
Frenchman, the British soldier with whom he grappled at
Waterloo&mdash;but enemies or aliens no longer, they pass, if
they do not recognise each other, as friends.&nbsp; This congress
on pacific terms, with a cordial understanding, is a spectacle on
which the eye loves to linger, and over which the heart of the
philanthropist dilates with hope.&nbsp; Now, does not this
festival, <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>without any far-fetched application, seem to say to
every one of us, as members of a family, that surely at this time
consistency is added to the other grounds of duty which require
us to cultivate towards those related to us by nature an
unsuspicious temper, a frank and open disposition, a desire to
conciliate where differences have arisen, and a determination to
cement where cordiality prevails?&nbsp; Should not each endeavour
to make his home&mdash;whether mansion or cottage, hall or
hut&mdash;a sanctuary sacred to peace and concord?&nbsp; Should
not each man now more than ever aspire to the fulfilment of the
office and the enjoyment of the benediction described and
pronounced by the Divine Teacher of love, &ldquo;Blessed are the
peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unseemly and inconsistent is it, while we are
inviting foreigners to forget past enmities, to consign to
oblivion by-gone strife, for any of us to allow domestic
jealousies and heart-burnings to torment our breasts, which
should be full of domestic charities and sympathies.&nbsp; While
thousands, of different colours, climes, and costumes, join to
bury the hatchet of strife under the Hyde Park elms, let those
who own a <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>common parentage, who in childhood sat on the same
knee, and were nursed in the same bosom, or whose relationship,
though not so intimate, is far from remote, between whom, alas,
differences have sprung up, seek by mutual concession to arrive
at a better understanding, and thus render the present year
memorable in their domestic annals.&nbsp; It would be a beautiful
incident to associate with this bright passage in the history of
the world a few lines relating to reconciliation and love, where
private strifes had embittered hearts intended by nature and
providence to be ever one.</p>
<p>The religion of Jesus Christ, as it is intended to bring
together the nations of the earth in amity, is also meant to bind
together the inmates of a home in friendship.&nbsp; Wherever its
laws are submitted to, and its spirit imbibed, there peace must
reign, and the domestic circle be a refuge from strife.&nbsp; The
gospel teaches lessons above all others suited to this end.&nbsp;
It points the master to God, the model of fatherly government,
and bids him remember that he has a Master in heaven.&nbsp; It
speaks to the husband, and points to Jesus Christ, bidding the
husband love his wife &ldquo;as Christ loved the <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>church.&rdquo;&nbsp; It speaks to the parents, and
charges them to train up their children &ldquo;in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; It speaks to sons and
daughters, commanding them to honour their father and mother, and
&ldquo;obey them in the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; It speaks to servants,
and tells them to &ldquo;be obedient to such as are their masters
according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of
heart as unto Christ, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but
as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this great world of strife what should be
so peaceful as a Christian home?&nbsp; Amidst the storms which
rock life&rsquo;s ocean, where shall we find a harbour if not
there?&nbsp; While divisions are rife, where shall we find union,
if not among the branches from a common parentage?&nbsp; Scenes
of domestic purity, innocence, and love there are to be met with
in many of the homes of our land, over which religion has thrown
its shield, where a happy exemption from the evils which tear
society in pieces is enjoyed; where surely some relic is to be
found of what Eden was; where the parent&rsquo;s care, like a
deep-rooted tree, spreads out its graceful branches, while the
children&rsquo;s love, like fragrant and flowery <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>creepers,
twists and curls tenacious tendrils around the venerable stem,
&ldquo;recompensing well the strength it borrows with the grace
it lends,&rdquo; and the dew of God&rsquo;s blessing, and the
sunshine of God&rsquo;s smile, fall upon them one and all.&nbsp;
Happy scenes these, which Jesus visits as he did the feast at
Cana, and the home at Bethany, teaching such families out of his
own word, sanctifying them by his gracious Spirit, guiding them
by his perfect example, protecting them by his mighty power,
comforting them by his unfailing sympathy, and preparing them for
a better home of which he gives them glimpses as they read the
Bible and kneel together at the footstool of God&rsquo;s
throne.&nbsp; Through faith in the gospel, and prayer for the
grace of Him who is its source and life, these scenes might be
greatly multiplied: and who but must desire it, and strive for
its promotion, so that while this year we invite the nations to
meet as a family, the family may meet as the brethren of Christ
and the children of God.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The character and spirit of the gathering suggest a
farther lesson connected with our individual interests and our
spiritual relations.</p>
<p>Would we fain look on the present year as <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>sacred to
reconciliation and peace? let each one inquire whether he has
ensured the enjoyment of those blessings in their most precious
and enduring forms!&nbsp; It is a fact, to which the
consciousness of most thoughtful men bears witness, that in
connexion with the intellectual harmony of their nature, there is
sad discord in their moral experience.&nbsp; The heart is divided
against itself&mdash;its little world is full of rebellion and
strife, torn in pieces by intestine war, like an empire in the
anarchy of an interregnum, even as that clear-sighted Hebrew,
looking at himself in the radiance of a light which fell from
heaven, most plainly saw, and mournfully confessed, when he
cried, to his and our true Lord and Maker, &ldquo;<i>unite</i> my
heart to fear thy name!&rdquo;&nbsp; That inward confusion
indicates the rejection of a Divine law of order, and that fact
explains the secret of many a man&rsquo;s misery.&nbsp; The
material world out of which he gathers the triumphs of art, and
the intellectual power by which he achieves his victories over
the physical, are in a state of unvarying subjection to law, and
hence the admired results of his formative genius and taste; but
he himself, the innermost and moral self, is out of harmony with
law.&nbsp; Hence the <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>disorder and trouble which human
beings carry with them everywhere, amidst the harmony and order
of external nature; which, with a still small voice, reproves
them for their disobedience.&nbsp; Some lead mournful, miserable
lives; they strive to be happy, but happiness flies from
them.&nbsp; All kinds of expedients are adopted to secure inward
peace; but these all fail.&nbsp; The disappointed ones still
try.&nbsp; Again cheated of the prize, they try&mdash;it is in
vain.&nbsp; And do you not know the secret of your sorrow?&nbsp;
You lay it perhaps on circumstances, or friends, or on the world,
or on nature, or on God.&nbsp; You invent causes and miss the
right one.&nbsp; Here it is lying within yourself, in your own
heart and will.&nbsp; Your inward life is not under the rule of
the great God.&nbsp; His laws run in one direction, and carry
happiness with them.&nbsp; Your soul rushes in an opposite
direction, and dashes against these laws.&nbsp; The collision is
your misery and ruin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You stretch out your hand
against God, and strengthen yourself against the Almighty.&nbsp;
You run upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his
bucklers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s heart, divided against itself,
throwing off the yoke of law, is at emnity with God.&nbsp; Divine
<a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>relations are disturbed.&nbsp; The bonds which alone
could bind safety and peace to the human soul, by binding that
soul to the omnipotent and loving Father of all, are ruptured and
destroyed; and thus, giving up its Guide and Guardian, the
wandering child is left to battle with storms in the dark ocean
of evil over which it strives to push its bark.&nbsp; How can
there be security to a creature who breaks away from God?&nbsp;
How can that bosom be at peace in which there is no love to
him?&nbsp; His law has sanctions, as all effectual and perfect
law must ever have&mdash;pain and trouble therefore follow
disobedience here and hereafter.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wages of sin is
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such being the facts of the case, the first desire of all
should be to secure reconciliation with God, with law, with
conscience.&nbsp; The gospel, and it only, reveals the method of
this reconciliation.&nbsp; It teaches us that there is redemption
in Jesus Christ; that God has set him forth to be a propitiation
through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the
remission of sins; that whoso believeth in him is justified; that
there is no condemnation to them that are in him; that he is our
peace; that to as many as receive him he gives power to become <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>the sons of
God; that being made sons they receive not the spirit of bondage
again to fear, but the spirit of adoption, whereby they cry,
Abba, Father; that his people are renewed and sanctified through
his Spirit, that dwelleth in them; that the righteousness of the
law is fulfilled in them who walk not after the flesh but after
the spirit; and that having access by faith unto this grace
wherein we stand, they rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>
<p>This Divine reconciliation, inward order, and holy peace are
our best qualifications for seeking to promote domestic
reconciliation, national order, and the world&rsquo;s
peace.&nbsp; They are the proper preparatives for all usefulness,
private and public&mdash;for all works of love towards our
fellow-men.&nbsp; For how inconsistent it is to think of binding
up the wounds of a family, curing the ills of the commonwealth,
or bringing a divided world together&mdash;while the very soul,
dreaming of these achievements, is a spectacle of sorrow to
unseen beings; inasmuch as it is engaged in an impotent warfare
against its God, and is bleeding under fatal injuries inflicted
on itself in a struggle so unutterably awful and insane.&nbsp;
Fraternity! concord! union!&nbsp; <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>These beautiful words come with a
melancholy and mocking sound from any lips but those which have
prayed for union with God, concord with law, and fraternity with
a holy obedient universe.&nbsp; How touching also, even to tears,
is it to think that any of the minds so richly gifted by the
Creator should devote themselves through life to artistic and
intellectual toils, for the sole purpose of bringing into fair
proportion and symmetry rude heaps of matter, or confused
elements of thought&mdash;while their own nature, in itself and
its highest relations, is left &ldquo;without form, and
void,&rdquo; like the primeval deep, its face covered over with
darkness.</p>
<p>These blessings to which we have referred alone can
satisfy.&nbsp; Other things, however fair and good&mdash;success
in the formation of the beautiful, and even the production of the
beneficent, leave a consciousness of want until the human spirit
be reconciled to itself and God.&nbsp; The soul wonders why the
cup in which it has mixed such sweet ingredients should yet be
dashed with bitterness; but so it must be while the vessel itself
retains the wormwood of its spiritual enmities.&nbsp; Let the cup
be cleansed; let the moral nature be renewed and purified by a
reconciling <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>faith in the One Mediator; and then shall the man,
however disappointed before, find himself blessed above all
mortal blessedness.</p>
<p>These blessings too are of an enduring character.&nbsp; It
were to tell an oft-told truth, if we described the limited
existence of all works of art and genius; if we reminded the
reader of the crumbling touch of time, and pointed him to the
all-enveloping ruins of the last day, when &ldquo;the elements
shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth and all the works
that are therein shall be burned up.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these
common themes are as indisputable and awful as they are common:
nor should any one forget them as he looks on the palace of
<i>glass</i>&mdash;(how forcibly symbolic is that word)&mdash;and
on the manifold structures, possessions, and achievements of
men.&nbsp; In contrast with such brittle objects, how strong in
enduring strength is that spiritual good to which, in the
conclusion of this volume, we direct, with intense desire and
hope, the thoughts of every reader.&nbsp; &ldquo;The world
passeth away and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of
God abideth for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Divine favour, so plainly
promised to such, is an inheritance exempt from the condition of
time, <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>change, and mortality.&nbsp; It is a treasure brought
down to us from another world, and will be carried back there by
him who finds it.&nbsp; In the silent musings of eternity the
soul, reconciled to God through faith in the blood of Jesus
Christ, will be able to look back with unspeakable satisfaction
on a course through this world, in which the only thing not
doomed to perish with itself was secured and appropriated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could not stay in that earth,&rdquo; will be the
reflection of so happy a spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw but a little
while what it had within it of the beautiful and the sublime in
God&rsquo;s works, and in the works which God enabled man to
accomplish; I left them there to perish, and on the last day I
saw them perish: but in my passage I discerned, by the aid of the
Divine Spirit, something better than all that they signified to
me.&nbsp; I seized the Pearl of great price and have brought that
away.&rdquo; <a name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a>&nbsp; On the other hand, how
inexpressibly dreadful must be the recollection of the opposite
class of human souls,&mdash;of all unreconciled, unregenerate,
earthly, sensuous, and even merely intellectual ones,&mdash;who
will be for ever tortured with the <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>accusation of their own mortifying
and fatal folly, because they will have passed through a world of
perishable objects with <i>only one</i> thing imperishable, and
in striving to enjoy them forget that, and after a life of toil,
ambition, and hope, came away with <i>nothing</i>.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
